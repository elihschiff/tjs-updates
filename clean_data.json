Trader Joe's 5 Cheese Greek Spiral is an item we've \ndeveloped there based on a savory pie from the region of Kozani. The Kichi Kozani is a long, thin filo pastry \nthat's been stuffed with cheese and coiled to resemble a snail's shell or gathered length of rope. \n\nThis pie's filling is traditionally a blend of feta and some kind of harder cheese. We don't presume to improve \nupon cultural food traditions as rich and deep as that of Greece\u00bf but then again, we are Trader Joe's. Going \nwith our gut, we wanted more kinds of cheese for more-cheesy flavor. We settled on a blend of five: gouda, kasseri, \nkefalotyri, semi-hard cheese, and blue cheese. This combination of cow's-, sheep's-, and goat's-milk cheeses \nwrapped in filo is baked (by you) in a 375\u00baF oven until golden-crisp on top and melty-good inside.\n\nMade for us near Thessaloniki (not too far from where the Kichi Kozani originates) our fourteen-ounce, \n5 Cheese Greek Spiral is now as close to you as the Trader Joe's freezer case.

A cross between Golden Delicious and Topaz apples, Opal Apples first appeared in 1999, but \nit wasn't until 2010 that they made their first appearance in the United States. Even now, years later, supply \nof these sunshine-yellow apples is so limited that Trader Joe's is one of the few retailers in the entire country \nwhere you will find them.\n\nWhat's so special about these pommes?  They're enticingly sweet, pack serious crunch, and perhaps most \nmiraculously, they are naturally resistant to browning when cut. What that means for you is that you can cut \nthem up and serve them in a salad - no browning. You can slice them and add them to a lunchbox - no brown-\ning. You can present wedges on a cheese tray - no browning. This makes them almost as appealing when cut as \nthey are when left whole. Almost.\n\nWe're selling conventionally grown Opal Apples for $1.19 each in our East Coast, Midwest, and Southeast \nstore locations.  In our Texas and West Coast stores, we're selling Organic Opal Apples for $1.29 each.  Both \nare shining values ripe for the picking.",

And while Argan Oil may be all the rage these days, it's more than just a flash-in-the-pan product-\nit's an age-old Moroccan beauty secret. \n\nAllegedly first discovered for use by the Phoenicians in 1550 B.C., Argan Oil has been an Eastern Hemisphere \ncosmetic (and culinary) staple for centuries. The fruit of the argan tree (Argania spinosa L.) is small, round, \nfleshy, and anchored by a hard \"nut.\" Each nut contains one to three small argan kernels, and workers must \naccess these kernels in order to extract the oil.  Most attempts to mechanize this process have been unsuccessful, \nso workers typically still peel the fruit and crack the nuts by hand. Our supplier purchases oil from various \nMoroccan women's cooperatives, and every last drop of it is USDA-certified organic. \n\nUnlike other cosmetic oils (Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E Oil, Coconut Oil, etc.), Argan Oil is noticeably silky, lightweight, \nand non-greasy; it absorbs quickly, and yet is still deeply moisturizing. Use it in place of face and/or body lotion. \nSmooth it into wet or dry hair to moisturize and tame frizz. Rub it onto dry, chapped hands and cuticles. This \nvitamin E and fatty acid-rich oil isn't called \"liquid gold\" for nothing...it does it all.\n\nWe're selling each 1.7-fluid ounce bottle of Organic Argan Oil for just $6.99. This comes to about $4 per ounce, \nwhich is an unheard of value-we've never seen it sold for any less than $7 per ounce, and these versions are \noften non-organic, chock full of additives, and/or overwhelmed by added fragrance.

  "item_story_qil": "Have you ever wondered why salmon and citrus seem to go so perfectly hand in hand? We certainly have, and \nas it turns out, there's a few reasons why. Part of it has to do with amines, the naturally occuring chemicals in \nfish meat responsible for what we call that \"fishy\" smell. When those make contact with an acid, like lemon \njuice, it causes a chemical reaction that converts them to amine salts, which have no smell, thus neutralizing \nany \"fishy\" aromas. In a relatively fatty fish like salmon, that citric acid also cuts through the fat and help the \nother flavors sing. Which is precisely why we've paired beautifully center-cut filets of Atlantic salmon with pre-\nprepped pats of lemon and herb butter in Trader Joe's Atlantic Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter, to show that \nall this technical talk isn't just theoretical - it's downright delicious.\n\nUncommonly convenient and quick-cooking, each boneless filet takes just 10-15 minutes in the oven at 400\u00b0F \nto go from thawed to flawlessly flaky and flavorful. As the filet cooks, the Lemon Herb Butter melts over the \nSalmon, infusing it with flavors of zesty citrus, aromatic herbs, and - lest we forget - rich, creamy butter, \nwhich also serves to help crisp up the skin underneath. All in all, it creates an exceptionally tasty protein that \ncan easily become a full-fledged meal with the simple addition of some rice, roasted veggies, or a salad. And \ntop of all that, each seven-ounce filet of Atlantic Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter sells for the stellar retail of \n$4.99*.

Michoac\u00e1n's tropical climate, rich volcanic soil, and ample rainfall make it an ideal area for avocado \ncultivation. \n\nThe differing elevations on the (inactive) volcanic slopes result in multiple microclimates. So, depending on \nlocation, trees bloom at different times during the year-which means there are always fresh avocados to be \nhad! Avocados are also plentiful because individual trees actually bloom and produce fruit twice each year. An \nabundant avocado crop not only means plenty of avocados for eating, but it also equates to plenty left over for \nmaking Trader Joe's Avocado Oil.\n\nAvocado Oil is high in monounsaturated fats and an excellent cooking oil, with a smoke point of 520\u00baF (signifi-\ncantly higher than olive oil, which has a smoke point closer to 350\u00baF). The clean, delicate flavor is a great match \nfor all kinds of uses, from saut\u00e9ing to baking to searing to garnishing. \n\nTrader Joe's Avocado Oil is an excellent addition to your pantry, and a good alternative to olive or other vegeta-\nble oils.

They proudly came back with Trader Joe's Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.\n\nMade with a mix of soy and pea protein, these vegan Wings have a remarkably meaty texture that's crisp on \nthe outside and satisfying juicy on the inside. They only take a few minutes to prep in the air fryer (or a little \nbit longer in the oven), and each bag comes with a packet of also-vegan, Buffalo-Style hot sauce to give each \nWing that classic, cayenne kick to every bite. We recommend them as an appetizer or snack when you've got \nfolks over to watch a game or movie, as a companion to our Vegan Meatless Meat Eater's Pizza [sku 70303], or \nas the center of a spicy, Chickenless sandwich layered with shredded lettuce and pickles.\n\nBuffalo Style\nChickenless Wings",

This slightly acidic sandstone helps mitigate unwanted bacteria and yeasts \nwhile still allowing for a remarkably humid environment for the cheese to age. The location of our Cave Aged \nBlue Cheese is also notable for being produced at the same site as the first produced American blue cheese.\n\nPair with your favorite hoppy IPA or APA, a crisp sauvignon blanc, or top fresh salads and burgers for extra \ntanginess. Trader Joe's Cave Aged Blue Cheese is a delicious, versatile venture into the world of blue cheeses. \nGrab a cut today from our cheese section for only $6.99* a pound and you'll surely have no reason to feel blue.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nCave Aged Blue Cheese",

Plus, the paper itself is milled in \nCanada and Wisconsin, by two Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\u00ae-certified sustainable operations. Pretty cool, eh? \n\nOnce the Cards are printed and ready to go, each one is paired with an envelope and carefully hand-placed into its \nprotective sleeve-a small but important step in the card-making process that creates employment opportunities for \nover 400 intellectually and physically disabled adults every year.

Sure, it had its friendly Coconut Cream [sku 98902] cousins, but it was still longing to be a part of a \ndynamic duo. So, we began our search for its other half.\n\nWe had three main goals for this product: One, we wanted it to be organic. Two, we wanted it to be free from \nadded gums. Three, of course, we wanted it to be both lower in fat and great-tasting. Trader Joe's Organic \nReduced Fat Coconut Milk scores on all three counts! \n\nOur Sri Lankan supplier starts with organically-grown King Coconuts. As true \"coconut scientists,\" these experts \nknow how to press shredded coconut meat at different stages and blend the resulting milks with filtered water to \ncreate the exact flavor profile and fat content we are looking for. The result is a milk with clean, coconutty flavor \nand a coconut aroma. The texture is smooth and milky-not too thick or too thin. Amazingly, we've achieved \nthis texture with no thickeners or gums (additives that are present in most of the other coconut milk brands \nyou'll find in the marketplace). Because of the lack of gums, there may be some separation in the can. This can \nbe easily remedied by shaking the can before opening, or gently heating the product by placing the can in some \nwarm water.\n\nCook with it-our Organic Reduced Fat Coconut Milk is excellent in curries. Drink it-it's fantastic in \nsmoothies, as a substitute for dairy in tea or coffee, or straight from the can (though we recommend pouring \nit into a nice, smooth-rimmed drinking glass first).

We take \nour cheeses seriously, and we know our customers do too, so we're willing to trek wherever necessary to find \nthe real deal.\n\nIn some cases, we literally must go to where the cheese is, if we want that cheese at all.

In order to \nfind a supplier that met these conditions, we ventured to the Jura Mountains in eastern France, near the Swiss \nborder. There we found a third-generation cheese maker whose fromagerie has been in business since 1907. \nOne bite of their Comt\u00e9, and we knew the journey was worth it. \n\nCreamy, nutty, and delightfully fruity in flavor, Trader Joe's Comt\u00e9 is deliciously complex, with fine notes of \nfreshly mown grass and a superb semi-firm mouth feel-due in no small part to it being aged for a minimum of \n180 days before being sold.

Our supplier, a highly regarded bakery in South San Francisco, makes the dough  \nin a completely refrigerated environment, which helps prevent proofing before bake time. As part of the \nfermentation process, the dough is allowed to mature for 8 to 10 hours to develop full flavor. Then, each \nCroissant is hand rolled and layered using a traditional French laminating technique. Twenty-four thin layers \nof dough are layered with superior butter sourced from the Pacific Northwest. In the center of each pastry goes \na special semi-sweet chocolate baton from South America.\n\nDuring baking, the butter melts, resulting in a flaky, buttery pastry-golden brown, crisp, and slightly bubbly \non the outside with a soft, airy crumb (interior). Of course, the middle presents a melty bite of chocolate. Our \nChocolate Croissants are fantastic right out of the package, or warmed up just a little.

Our Pecorino \nRomano is aged a minimum of five months to still have that sweet, young cheese essence, but stacked with \nsharp and salty notes.

Every bite is full-flavored, satisfying, and marvelously multi-\ntextured, setting a new standard for mealtime mash-ups.\n\nEqually delicious as a weekend snack, school lunch, or late night treat, this Cheeseburger Burrito can be \nprepped in the microwave for a soft-textured tortilla, or heated in a conventional oven or skillet for a crispier \nexterior. It pairs especially well with burger stand standards like french fries or tots, and just like a typical \nburritom it can be customized with hot sauces, salsas, or even more melted cheese.  \n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nCheeseburger Burrito",

Since then, as Trader \nJoe's Chimichurri Sauce deftly demonstrates, its uses have expanded to include sandwiches and seafood, \nburgers and kebabs, pastas and potatoes - pretty much anything that's savory and delicious will be even more \nso with a bit of Chimichurri on top.\n\nStarting with a mix of finely chopped parsely and cilantro, our supplier adds in minced garlic, dried cumin, and \ncrushed red pepper, then blends in a mix of oil and vinegar. The resulting Sauce is a compellingly complex mix \nof herby aromatics, savory spice, silky texture, and even a delicately tart note that serves to wake up the flavors \nwithin any entr\u00e9e it's added to. We especially like it with grilled shrimp on crispy crostini, al pastor tacos with \ncharred pineapple, roasted sweet potatoes with crumbled cotjia, or, of course, a freshly seared steak.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nChimichurri Sauce",

If you're in the mood to share, serve these Mini Ice Cream Cones at parties-\nthey're perfect for a simple-but-highly-Instagram-able baby shower, birthday party, graduation banquet, etc. \nPlus, they're an incredible value. We've increased the overall weight of the product by a third (from 5.9 to 7.89 \nounces, to be exact), but we haven't increased the price-each box of 8 Mini Chocolate Ice Cream Cones is still \njust $2.99.

It replaces the typical two-step shampoo and conditioner hair-care ritual with one product that \nsimultaneously cleans and conditions, leaving your hair soft and shiny! \n\nMany shampoos contain detergents that strip hair of its natural oils, which often leads to dry strands and itchy \nscalps. Our Hair Wash doesn't contain any detergents, sulfates, parabens, or silicone-so you're left with clean \nhair, minus the harsh side effects that result from shampoo overuse. Products like this one are often referred to \nas \"co-washes\"-conditioners that are used to both wash and condition hair-and they're becoming a popular \nalternative for good reason. By co-washing, your hair won't need to be washed as frequently. It will hydrate dry \nhair and help tame frizz while enhancing texture and adding volume. \n\nTo use our Cleansing & Conditioning Hair Wash, simply wet your hair and apply it to your hair and scalp. \nIt won't foam up like typical shampoos (that's what detergents do); it will feel more like a creamy conditioner. \nEnjoy the invigorating grapefruit and minty scent while you massage it into your hair and scalp then rinse \nthoroughly.

When coconuts are young and green, their endocarp is filled \nwith endosperm, which consists of white flesh and a watery liquid that serves as nutrition for the growing \ncoconut seed.

It seems like a negligible distinction, but we take such distinctions \nseriously-especially when it comes to Trader Joe's Cream Cheese.\n\nWithin the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a \"brick.\" Brick, however, \nsounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not \ntreated with rBST, it's everything you want cream cheese to be-rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread-\nable. So, rather than \"brick,\" we'd like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a \"block,\" as in \"building block,\" since it \ncan be a building block in so many delicious dishes.\n\nWhat's that? You want examples? Sure. A simple appetizer idea: set it on a plate, top with salsa or sweet chili \nsauce and serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a Mexican or Thai inspired dip. How's that for instant versa-\ntility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips. Don't forget bagels-but \nhow could you forget bagels? Pretzel Bagels [sku 52370], maybe? Perhaps our favorite usage for this particular \nbuilding block is cheesecake. If you're up to the challenge of making a cheesecake from scratch, you won't find \na better foundation.\n\nPerhaps the biggest WOW of all is our price of $1.69 for each eight-ounce block of certified kosher Trader Joe's \nCream Cheese. You'll find it in our cheese case, next to other cream cheeses not in \"block\" form.",

The crispy, crunchy, dried \ngarlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes \nbuild onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the \nolive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all \nthe other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning.\n\nWhich brings us to its application: we happily contend that Chili Onion Crunch truly does taste great on \neverything. Pizzas, burgers, burritos, hummus - anything and everything that you'd add hot sauce, steak sauce, or \neven just salt and pepper to, will benefit greatly from Chili Onion Crunch. Seriously: hot dogs, pasta, omelettes, \nchow mein - we really could keep going. We haven't tried it on ice cream yet, but we're certainly not ruling it out. \n\nOf course, at Trader Joe's, the spice that always goes with everything is value, so we're proud to say that Trader \nJoe's Chili Onion Crunch works well with that, too: we're selling six-ounce jars for $3.99, every day. You'll find \nthem in our grocery aisle.\n\n06.24.\n19",

The Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar\u00ae \nis made primarily of (you guessed it!) peanut butter, which thickens and binds with the addition of honey, \norganic nonfat dry milk, organic dried whole egg, organic rice protein, various organic oils, and a blend of or-\nganic whole food powders (think: spinach, kelp, apple, orange, etc.) You'll also find that each bar is upgraded \nwith a pinch of sea salt and rich, organic dark chocolate chips. Mmmm, chocolate...\n\nPerfect Bars\u00ae are gluten free, kosher, and non-GMO. They're cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any \nadded preservatives or emulsifiers-and because of this, these bars should be kept in the refrigerator so that \ntheir flavor and consistency remain intact. They can last up to one week at room temperature, though, so \ndon't be afraid to toss one in your purse, backpack, or workout bag. \n\nWe're selling each 2.3-ounce Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar\u00ae for $1.99-less than you'll \nfind these delicious slabs of peanut butter-y goodness anywhere else. \n\n07.05.\n17",

We've been carrying Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese for decades because we believe the \nsemi-soft texture and fresh, buttery flavors are a great representation of the hall(den)mark Danish cheese. \n\nThe story of Danish Havarti is one of a noble 1800s exploit where a farmer based just north of Copenhagen \ntraveled around the European continent in search for knowledge about cheesemaking. When she returned \nfrom her travels in 1852, she developed the technique to make the uniquely Danish Harvati Cheese. While this \ntechnique yielded a semi-firm cheese dotted with small holes, it is a bit different than what's modernly made \nas \"fl\u00f8dehavarti\" or \"cream Havarti\". Trader Joe's Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese is made using pasteurized \nmilk that allows whey proteins to stick around that would otherwise be eliminated while processing the curd, \ngiving it a signature creamy texture and taste. Ripened very little, cream Havarti Cheese has a mellow, buttery \naroma, much like that of Swiss cheese, and a sweet, creamy, paste with mild saltiness and nutty notes. While \nwe're touting the lovely simplicity of our traditional Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese, it is a variety of cheese \noften adorned with added flavors such as dill (like our Havarti Cheese with Dill [sku 72490]), garlic, cranberries, \njalape\u00f1os, you name it! It has an accessible flavor that works wonderfully as the main attraction, but is equally \ntasty when taking a backseat to bolder flavors.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nCreamy Danish Havarti Cheese",

In a process known as \"felting,\" skilled workers wrap the wool into loose balls, \nwet them with warm water, hand-roll them while applying significant pressure, then lay them in the sun to dry. \n(The combination of moisture and warmth works to compact and stiffen the wool fibers-if you've ever had the \nmisfortune of accidentally tossing your favorite wool sweater in the wash, you're familiar with this phenomenon\u00bf) \nFinally, once the Wool Balls are completely dry, they're grouped into sets of four, packaged in cotton drawstring \nbags (no plastic packaging here, folks!), and shipped to your neighborhood TJ's. \n\nTrader Joe's Wool Dryer Balls can be reused for years on end-they really are the perfect, eco-chic replacement for \nthose waxy, disposable dryer sheets you've been using. Simply toss all four Balls in the dryer with your laundry, and \nthey'll reduce static, decrease dry time, make clothes fluffier, and keep fabrics softer. Unlike others on the market, \nour Wool Dryer Balls are free from dyes and fragrances. But that said, if you would like to scent your laundry, just \nadd a few drops of your favorite essential oil (time to break out the TJ's Essential Oils Collection!) to one of the Dryer \nBalls, and you'll have laundry that's lightly scented but still free from chemical fragrances.\n\nSpeaking of being unlike others on the market, perhaps the most unique feature of our Wool Dryer Balls is their \nprice: we're selling each set of four for $5.49. That's an incredible value; these very same Dryer Balls are sold for two \n(or three!) times as much elsewhere. You'll find them with our household products.\n\n09.17.\n18",

Their soft, yielding texture and naturally hearty flavor make them \na great asset for savory dishes like pestos, salads, and stuffings, too. And since these Hazelnuts in particular \nare dry roasted but not salted, they're a great blank slate for use in whatever culinary scheme you may have \ngoing. You can halve them and saut\u00e9 them with your favorite greens, crush them and use them to create a super \nflavorful crust for pork or fish. The sky's the limit! And at $6.99 for a 16-ounce bag, you can afford to be even \nmore adventurous with how you use them. That might be the most fun fact of all. \n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nDry Roasted & Unsalted Oregon Hazelnuts",

While Trader Joe's Egg Salad is certainly delightful \non its own, it truly sings as part of an egg salad sandwich.

This method-as \nopposed to the typical \"continuous fry\" method of chip-making-results in extra-flavorful chips with a harder, \ncrunchier bite. But let's not pretend the potatoes are the star of this show-as they say, \"It's the seasoning, silly!\" \nWe're talking salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper (plus a pinch of \nsugar, a splash of sesame oil, and additional natural flavors), a.k.a. all that and a bag of chips\u00bfliterally.\n\nAt TJ's we talk a whole lot about value, so instead of charging a pretty penny for these scrumptious specialty Chips \nlike another store might, we're selling TJ's Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Kettle Cooked Potato Chips for \n$2.49* per seven-ounce bag. You'll find them in our snack section. \n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nEverything But the Bagel \nSeasoned Kettle-Cooked Potato Chips",

Indeed, by definition, focaccia (or panis \nfocacius, as the Romans called it) was associated with the warmth and comfort of home from the very start. In \nthat same tradition, we're setting our focus on the warmth and comfort of this soft, savory bread with Trader \nJoe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan.\n\nHarkening back to its Ancient Roman roots, Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread is baked on a heated tile inside of \na blazing hot, stone hearth oven. These conditions allow the bread to form the crisp, light crust and soft, airy \ncrumb texture that focaccia is famous for. Our supplier also upholds an equally important (and delicious) \ntradition by topping each loaf with extra virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs, flavorful roasted tomatoes, and a \ngenerous dusting of finely-grated Parmesan cheese. Put together, each bite is a marvelous mix of iconic Italian \nflavors, perfect for serving alongside pasta, dipping into a mixture of olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena \n[sku 12800], or slicing and lightly toasting for use in sandwiches.\n\nNow that we've focused on Focaccia, let's take a moment to focus on value - we're selling each 14-ounce \nloaf of Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan for $3.99.

Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that \ncan be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates.\n\nWhat makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream \"French\", you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself \n(which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base \nthat contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French \ntradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream.  \nNotice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one \ngallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice \nCream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream! We're selling each one quart container of French \nVanilla Ice Cream for $3.99*.

Eliminating heat from the prep process for foods like these not only preserves important \nnutrients, but also allows the best and truest flavors to shine through. \n\nSuch is definitely the case with coffee. While we're not concerned with \"preserving nutrients\" in a coffee drink, \nflavor is of the utmost importance. Flavor is the \"why\" behind our new French Vanilla Cold Brew Coffee. \nLike our Black Cold Brew [sku 56952], this one starts with 100% Arabica coffee beans from Central and South \nAmerica. These beans are roasted (sometimes heat is necessary!) before they are coarsely ground and steeped in \ncold water for hours at a time. During this cold brew process, the beans are never exposed to heat, thus preserv-\ning the full, bold flavor of this coffee. This process also affords lower acidity for a less bitter, distinctively smooth, \neasy drinking beverage that's enhanced with milk, sugar, and the natural flavor of real vanilla from Madagascar.\n\nOur French Vanilla Cold Brew comes ready-to-drink. Keep the can chilled in the fridge for the next time you're \ncraving quality coffee, or put some on ice in a cooler to take on your picnic or to your next sporting event. With \nthe natural vanilla flavor, it's easy to enjoy as-is. Or, you can even make a double-vanilla affogato by pouring it \nover Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576].\n\nOther ready-to-drink cold brews will cost you upwards of $2.50, but we're selling our eight ounce can of Trader \nJoe's French Vanilla Cold Brew Coffee for $1.79. \n\n10.24.\n16",

If \nnot, the shelves of Trader Joe's just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u00bf Guava \nPaloma.  It comes to us from the folks at GT's\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful \nkombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented \ndrink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero \njuice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of \nprobiotic bacteria in every single bottle.\n\nEach bottle of Agua de Kefir\u00bf Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \"grains,\" which are actually grain-free, \ndairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \"grains\" are placed \nin reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. \nThis fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures \nto grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \"regular\" kefir-the dairy kind-come from similar processes, but the \nkefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic \nproperties, we're happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u00bf Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We \nrecommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a \nstrenuous yoga session.\n\nAgua de Kefir\u00bf\nGuava Paloma",

  "item_story_qil": "Halloumi is certainly not the only cultural or culinary export of Cyprus, but it's definitely one of our favorites. \nThis remarkably unique cheese would be notable for its taste and texture alone, which sit at a curious crossroads \nbetween mozzarella and feta. But of course, Halloumi goes the extra mile by having the deliciously unusual \ntrait of browning, rather than melting, when grilled or heated in a pan. Don't get us wrong - melted cheese \nis undoubtedly wonderful, but there's something about a slice of warm, freshly grilled Halloumi, striped with \ngloriously caramelized grill marks, that keeps up coming back for more. That's precisely why we're bringing \nAtalanta\u00ae Halloumi Cheese, proudly labeled as \"The Cheese That Grills,\" to our cheese case.\n\nLike all Halloumi (or at least all Halloumi that can legally be labled as such), Atalanta\u00ae Halloumi is made \non the island of Cyprus using sheep's milk. During production, the curds are heated to high temperatures, a \nprocess which gives it both its \"squeaky\" texture and ability to hold its shape when cooked or grilled. Atalanta\u00ae's \ncheesemakers also include a bit of mint, which adds a slight refreshing counterbalance to Halloumi's natural \nbrininess. We recommend pairing a grilled slice of Atalanta\u00ae Halloumi with fresh watermelon and a chilled \nglass of Freeda Ros\u00e9 [63104]. We also recommend acting quickly, as supplies are limited. While inventory lasts, \nyou can find 8.8-ounce packages of Atalanta\u00ae Halloumi in your Trader Joe's cheese case for $5.99*.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nAtalanta\u00ae Halloumi Cheese",

The answer (we hope) is Olive Wood Salt Cellars with Spoons!\n\nEach year after olive harvests, aged trees-some up to 600 years old-which no longer produce olives are removed \nfrom olive groves. Our Tunisian supplier takes this strikingly-grained wood and manufactures all kinds of elegant \nkitchen items, including these beautiful Olive Wood Salt Cellars. Fashionable and functional, each sturdy Salt \nCellar boasts a magnetic swing top lid to keep its contents clean and dry, and includes a handy Olive Wood Spoon \nthat fits into a notch in the bowl. Keep one on the counter and you'll always have a generous scoop of TJ's Fine \nCrystals Sea Salt [sku 47588] or TJ's Everything But The Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 59137] at the ready. \n\nExtend an Olive Wood Salt Cellar as a peace offering to a relative-or just as a lovely gift if you don't need to do any \npeacemaking. And don't forget to buy one for yourself. We're selling each very-limited-edition Trader Joe's Olive \nWood Salt Cellar with Spoon for the amazing price of $12.99, while supplies lasts. A value like this is sure to leave \nyou feeling at peace with your purchase.\n\nNOV. - DEC.\n\n11.19.\n18",

As those commitments pile up \r\nand as the holiday season looms around the corner, it's a good idea to make a little time for self-care. And for \r\nthose of us who don't have the time (or the funds) for an autumn day at the spa, Trader Joe's Pumpkin Spice \r\nBiocellulose Face Mask makes self-care-in-a-pinch a complete & total cinch. \r\n\r\nSingle-use sheet Masks are still all the rage in the world of at-home skin care, and ours is truly top of the line. \r\nFor starters, whereas most sheet masks are made from cotton or plant-based cellulose, TJ's Pumpkin Spice \r\nFace Mask is made from Biocellulose-a thinner, lab-made, compostable material formed from fermented \r\ncoconut fiber, that can retain up to four times more fluid than its \"regular\" cellulose counterpart. This allows \r\nthe Mask to contour & adhere to your face more securely, bringing even more of the serum in contact with your \r\nskin. This, you'll find, is a very good thing, because this skin-soothing, ultra-moisturizing, seasonally-spiced \r\nserum contains a bevvy of beneficial ingredients-like pumpkin seed & turmeric root extracts, aloe leaf juice, \r\nshea butter esters, colloidal gold, hydrolyzed silk protein, & more. (Plus a blend of clove flower, cinnamon bark, \r\norange peel, & ginger root oils to enhance its Pumpkin Spice-y scent...) \r\n\r\nFor a limited time, while our inventory lasts, we're selling single-use, individually-wrapped Trader Joe's \r\nPumpkin Spice Biocellulose Face Masks (.85 fluid ounces) for $2.99 each.\r\n\r\nPumpkin Spice Biocellulose Face Mask",

Highly-\nvalued and widely-used for its stable and powerful non-peroxide antibacterial activity, this honey is something \nspecial. The exorbitant pricing (a small jar can run from $20 - $50 dollars and up!) on Manuka, however, has been a \nbarrier for some folks. Until now. While traveling in New Zealand, our buyers discovered the only Manuka Honey \nproducer who is 100% vertically integrated. From the hives to the honey jar lid, they tend to it all. This structure \nallows for consistent production, as well as successful cost management-which leads to our exceptional price of \n$10.99 for a 8.8-ounce jar. \n\nOf course, it's what's in the jar that makes the real difference, and the quality of Mother Earth\u00ae New Zealand \nManuka Honey is exceptional. The hives are located in a remote valley on the North Island of New Zealand, \nwhere the bees collect nectar exclusively from the flowers of the Manuka bush (also known as the \"Tea Tree\"). This \nsingular pollen source is responsible for the robust flavor, which is sweet, with notes of menthol and eucalyptus. \n\nThe monofloral pollen source is also responsible for the sought after health-promoting potency, indicated by a \nUnique Manuka Factor (UMFTM) classification of: 10+. (The UMFTM is a trademark of the Active Manuka Honey \nOrganization, which has derived an internationally recognized testing and ranking process to verify the existence \nand strength of the non-peroxide antibacterial activity (10+ is good!). It is a designation that cannot appear on \nproduct packaging without licensure to do so, and since we know our customers are specifically looking for this \nattribute, we made the decision to replace our private-label TJ's Manuka Honey [sku 50760] with our vendor's \nbranded version: Mother Earth\u00ae New Zealand Manuka Honey. It's the exact same honey that meets the exact \nsame standards, only these standards are now more clearly noted. Honey, it's legit! You'll find it in our grocery aisle.",

Our supplier, from the Osaka region of Japan, blends bright yuzu zest with chili peppers \nand salt, creating a combination of sweet, spicy, and salty flavors. These flavors are delivered in a vinegar base, \nwhich adds a touch of sour and makes our version a pourable sauce (versus a paste). \n\nThe yellow-green sauce with its fragrant citrus aroma and fair amount of heat is an addicting fusion that makes \nany food 'pop.' Try it on beef, poultry, fish (cooked or raw), rice or vegetables. Incorporate some into your salad \ndressing, or marinade.

Trader Jos\u00e9's Hatch Valley Salsa meets each of these requirements and \nmore. While visiting New Mexico in August, we happened upon the seasonal harvest of Hatch Chiles. The \nHatch Chile Festival-in the town of Hatch, New Mexico-can draw up to 30,000 visitors annually. Visitors \nflock to experience the renowned flavor of peppers that share the town's name. But, these Chiles haven't just \ninherited the name; they've taken on the characteristics of the distinctive New Mexican terroir-the arid soil \nand dry climate that yield peppers with incomparable taste.\n\nNo matter whether it was chance, providence, or just a fluke that we showed up, once we smelled for ourselves \nthe aroma of chiles roasting over the fire, we hatched a plan. That plan has come to fruition in Trader Jos\u00e9's \nHatch Valley Salsa. The short ingredient list (Hatch Chiles, tomatillos, lime juice, and garlic salt) attests to \nthe impression these peppers can make on one's palate. The handpicked, flame-roasted Chiles are hot-not \nmelt-your-face-off hot, mind you-but definitely not mild. To these, we've added a small amount of tomatil-\nlos and limejuice to round out the flavor, balance the acidity, and tame the heat-ever so slightly. The result \nis a \"sauce\" that is excellent with tortilla chips, or to dress up a taco salad. Try hatching an egg (and then \nscrambling and cooking it) to build a better breakfast burrito with black beans, a little crumbled bacon, and a \nhealthy dose of this Salsa. Add some to your soups, stews, and crock-pot meals to bring the flavorful heat.\n\nIn case you can't get yourself to the festival, we're bringing Hatch Chiles to you. Keep life spicy with your own \n12-ounce jar of low calorie, low sodium, Hatch Valley Salsa for just $2.69. Muchas gracias, Trader Jos\u00e9!\n\n9.29.1\n4",

The \nIce Cream our new vendor makes is so deliciously dense because it contains only around 50% overrun (that's ice \ncream lingo for the amount of air whipped into the ice cream to expand its volume), which is impressive when \nyou consider that most ice cream used in frozen novelties contains around 90% overrun. Finally, the Cones are \ndipped-upside down, no less!-in more of that fine, fine chocolate. \n\nSnatch a Mini Cone (or three) out of the freezer whenever your sweet tooth calls-at under 100 calories each, they \nare easily worth the indulgence.

It puts \nin overtime for you, so why not return the favor by incorporating Trader Joe's Nourish Hyaluronic Moisture \nBoost Serum into your skincare routine?\n\nOne of the greatest challenges to maintaining great skin-particularly on the face-is keeping it moisturized. The \ngame plan here is simple, really: do all that you can to lock in your skin's natural moisture, then add to it as needed. \nHyaluronic acid (H.A.) does a little bit of both. A gram of the stuff can attract and hold onto several liters of water., \nand it helps form a light, non-greasy protective barrier on the skin. Our water-based, unscented, never-tested-on-\nanimals, non-comedogenic Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum was formulated by top dermatologists to contain \n1% sodium hyaluronate-which is the greatest possible percentage of the pure, salt form of H.A. that we can use \nwithout causing the product to bead. Sodium hyaluronate has an even lower molecular weight than hyaluronic \nacid, so it can penetrate the skin more easily than H.A. can. It's just what your pretty-but-parched visage needs. \n\nHyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum can be used in conjunction with any and all components of your regular \nbeauty regime, but it particularly complements other products from the TJ's Nourish line. Twice a day, cleanse \nwith All-In-One Facial Cleanser [sku 96404], apply a small amount of Serum to your entire face (and Antioxidant \nFacial Serum [sku 51150] if desired), then follow with a liberal application of Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer [sku \n56285].

This pasta goes well with chunkier \nsauces with cut up vegetables and larger chunks of meat or sausage. \nRigatoni is a tube, similar to penne, but with a larger diameter.  \nBoth pastas are cut using a Bronze Die (as opposed to the cheaper Teflon die). The \nBronze Die has a rough edge which scratches the pasta when it's cut (hence the whiter \nappearance). The result is, the pasta surface has more texture, which grips more sauce. \nMore sauce = more flavor. \n\nTrader Joe's Company Bulletin03/02/2011 page 42 of 43\n\nConfidential",

Since \nthe 1500s, Calabrian hot chili peppers have been a staple of Southern Italian cuisine, especially when crushed, \nfermented, and mixed into a firey hot condiment, just like this Bomba Sauce.

Our latest limited-release, small lot coffee, Trader Joe's Java of the Gods, comes to us from a collection \r\nof these farmers, and easily lives up to Parahyangan's name-each strong, full-bodied sip is practically divine.\r\n\r\nSemi-sweet, toasty, and marked with notes of cacao, our Java of the Gods has a substantial mouthfeel and \r\ndark, chocolatey profile that's ideal for serving with decadent desserts and all sorts of breakfast dishes, savory \r\nand sweet. When paired with a stack of syrupy Belgian Waffles [sku 96967] or toasted, buttered Pancake Bread \r\n[sku 63303], for instance, its relatively low acidity and semi-bitter edges (resulting from this Java's deep, dark \r\nroast) will cut through the sweetness, providing a captivating complement. When served alongside a savory \r\nomelette, breakfast sandwich, or plate of spicy chilaquiles, however, those same qualities will allow the stronger \r\nflavors from both the coffee and the food to intermingle and reinforce one another. However you pair this Java \r\nof the Gods, or even if you just plan to sip it solo, be sure to pick up a bag before too long, because supplies are \r\ndecidedly limited.\r\n\r\nJava of the Gods\r\nSmall Lot Coffee",

Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk \nseasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works \nequally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips.\n\nDrawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch \nof a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous \ndusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, \nnutmeg, and ginger extract. What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of \nspicy red chili pepper powder. As you snack, the spice builds steadily (but not altogether overwhelmingly) to an \nexhilarating crescendo of heat, making it a perfect treat for the real spice fans out there (you know who you are.)\n\nIndeed, Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips are big when it comes to spice, but they're actually quite modest \nwhen it comes to price: we're selling each six-ounce bag for $1.79, an especially great value when you consider \nthat most other flavored plantain chips out there sell for $3 and up.

In the world of salad, there are seemingly endless choices, so \nhow do you choose? Why not go with something new, something intriguing, something whose name sounds \na bit like you're talking about a hip clergy member? \n\nYes, friends, that would be Trader Joe's Kohlrabi Salad Blend. Kohlrabi is a relative of cabbage (its name \nderives from the German word for cabbage, actually) that's often mistaken for a root vegetable, though it does \ngrow above ground. We've combined this mild, slightly sweet-tasting green with shrredded kale, golden beets, \nand red cabbage. These veggies, grown in California (in springtime, the cabbage is sourced from Arizona as \nwell), come together to become a veritable superhero of a salad mix, and one you'll only find at Trader Joe's.\n\nToss the Kohlrabi Salad Blend with your favorite dressing, or break the cardinal rule of summer and actually \ncook - it's delicious saut\u00e9ed in olive oil with a bit of garlic and a sprinkling of sea salt, and only requires a few \nminutes on the stovetop.  We're selling each 10 ounce bag of Trader Joe's Kohlrabi Salad Blend for $2.49, a \ndelicious price. You'll find it in our refrigerated produce section with the other bagged salads.\n\n07.26.\n17",

The meat of choice in this popular dish is typically beef, \nsliced into thin strips, marinated in bulgogi sauce (basically a doctored soy sauce), and \"fired\" on a grill. We \nlove this dish, and have explored some of our own versions, like Trader Joe's Korean Inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried \nRice with Kimchi [sku 67480] to name just one. Continuing our exploration, we've chosen some less traditional \nterritory in the creation of Trader Joe's Korean Beefless Bulgogi.\n\nThe fire \"meat\" in this case is not meat at all. Instead, it's 100% Beefless textured soy protein. Even so, the \nmarinade is quite traditional, made by our Korean supplier (in the Republic of Korea) using common bulgogi-\nsauce ingredients, such as soy sauce, pear puree, garlic, ginger, green onions, and sugar. Though completely \nvegan, the texture of our Beefless Bulgogi is satisfyingly meat-like; and the savory, sweet, salty sauce adds \nauthenticity (not to mention enjoyability!) to the whole eating experience.\n\nKorean Beefless Bulgogi cooks from frozen in 3-7 minutes, depending on your chosen method. Serve it with \na side of Organic Jasmine Rice [63573], or in a stir fry with your favorite TJ's veggies.

They flew to the East \nCoast to experience the dish themselves, and even brought back samples for testing. As it often goes with these \nthings, the road to product perfection was long and arduous. It was a challenge to get the batter to cook up \ncrispy, due to the moisture released from the frozen cauliflower during baking.

\n\n*Beauty & The Geek: A micelle is a type of molecule cluster that has two opposing sides: one end loves water (hydrophilic); the \nother loathes it (hydrophobic). In a water solution, they molecules cluster into a spherical shape, with a water-loving exterior and \nwater-hating exterior. When gently applied to the skin, the molecules break, and in the process, thy gobble up whatever isn't water \n(dirt & residue) from the surface. When the pressure is lifted, the micelle clusters close again, taking away all but the water, which \nleaves the skin clean, fresh and moisture-rich.",

It's a relatively mild sheep's \nmilk cheese, so it's a great one to start with. \nIt's great on a fruit and cheese platter, \nespecially with stone fruit such as peaches, \napricots or cherries. Also serve it on French \nbread with ham and tomato or on a serving \nboard with cured meats, olives and pate.

To create our own ver-\nsion of the famous Southwestern Chinese dish, we brought together tender strips of beef and lightly blanched \nbroccoli florets, mixing them together in a traditional sauce flavored by red chile garlic puree, soy sauce, vinegar, \nmore garlic, ginger, more red chilies (crushed), and cayenne pepper. \n\nFour years later, we're reintroducing this dish as Trader Ming's Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef & Broccoli. The \ndifference? We took a hard look at the recipe and realized we could significantly reduce the amount of salt and \nsugar without compromising the great flavor. We brought the sodium down from the whopping 1390 mg that \nis was (!) to a mere 630 mg. That's a 55% reduction in sodium. We also significantly reduced the sugar, taking \nit down from 52 g to 27 g-a 48% reduction. Everything else is nearly identical\u00bf the wonderful contrast of the \ntender beef; the subtle crunch of the broccoli; the zesty zing of the chile-garlic sauce; and the overall balance of \nmild sweetness with just a little bit of heat.\n\nServe it with our Fully Cooked Brown Rice [sku 77409] and it can satisfy up to three hungry people. Get creative \nand wrap it in a tortilla for a spicy-sweet burrito, or serve it on a bed of greens for a unique salad. The sauce, the \nbroccoli, and the beef are still packaged separately to maintain their integrity, and the entire meal can be ready \nin about ten minutes.\n\nOur \"new\" Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef & Broccoli with lower sodium, and less sugar is just $6.99.

It's also entirely vegan, kosher certified, and fortified with calcium, and \nvitamins D & E. Best of all, it can be enjoyed all the same ways one would enjoy cow's milk.\n\nWhen it comes to quality products at low prices, other retail grocers might as well have \"All hope abandon, ye \nwho enter here!\" above their door.

Wild-caught in \nthe Atlantic Ocean, these clams are hand-shucked to avoid unnecessary processing that may affect the pure clam \nflavor or texture. Potatoes and saut\u00e9ed onions swim alongside the bright orange clams in a rich, roux-thickened \nfish stock tempered with light cream. Cooked in small batches and finished off with the perfect amount of pep-\nper, you'll look no further for a true New England Clam Chowder.\n\nWe poured a heaping portion of this Chowder into a microwave-friendly container for your quick and easy \nenjoyment. Dish it up in hollowed Mini Sourdough Boules [sku 96820] and sprinkle fried bacon pieces and fresh \nthyme on top. Or, add chopped parsley and a handful of Oyster Crackers [sku 42049] for a classic serving.\n\nWe might not have followed the 18th century recipe to a T, but the authentic flavor of Trader Joe's New England \nClam Chowder may make you forget you're not actually enjoying this chowdah on the coast of New England. \nEach 20-ounce container of this seasonal soup is $4.49, while available.\n\n10.05.\n15",

However, what we haven't done is offer a plain, nonfat, single-serve option\u00bf \nuntil now!\n\nTrader Joe's Greek Plain Nonfat Yogurt starts with Grade A, skim milk from cows that have never been \ngiven rBST hormones.

It also had to do with rye's dense, earthy, and pleasantly sour \ncharacter when milled and used in baked goods. Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips capitalize on \nrye's goodness by delivering this dark, delicious grain in a crisp, seedy cracker.\n\nA bakery in Norway makes our Sourdough Rye Chips. First, they bake bread from a wheat and rye sourdough \nthat includes whole-grain rye berries, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds. The bread is thinly sliced, fried in \nsunflower oil, and finished with a touch of salt. Each curved, irregularly shaped Chip has a super crunch that \nleads to nutty notes and rich rye flavor.\n\nWe enjoy Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips as a snack right out of the bag, but you can also \nuse them to add crunch to your salad. And they're strong enough for dipping into something savory, such \nas Chunky Artichoke Jalape\u00f1o Dip [sku 54698].

Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean \nfarmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes \nthat are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the \nseaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are \"raised\" out of the water, allowing \nsunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it's the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of \nunwanted species on the crop.\n\nOnce harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, & sprinkled with sea salt \n(the oil makes the salt stick.) The result is a yummy snack that is perfectly salty and rich in umami. This snack is \nmade even more perfect by our packaging-six, 0.17-ounce mini-packs, sold together in one, 1.05-ounce clear \npackage.

Inspired and shaped by that uniqueness, Trader Joe's \nOrganic Blood Orange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend plays to rooibos's natural strengths by adding in a blend of \ndried hibiscus, rose hips, orange peel, and a bit of orange oil to give a decidedly citric, tantalizingly tangy, and \nremarkably refreshing character.\n\nBecause of its lack of caffeine, our Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Tea makes an excellent choice for drinking \nanytime throughout the day, but we find its toasty orange peel edge is particularly great for sipping during the \nevening. Similarly, its natural juiciness and smooth profile lends itself to being served iced, or even brewed \ncold. Being the unique grocery store that we are, we're selling 1.13-ounce boxes of Trader Joe's Organic Blood \nOrange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend for $2.49*, every day - substantially less than what you'd pay for organic \nrooibos elsewhere. Look for them in our coffee and tea section.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nOrganic Blood Orange \nRooibos Herbal Tea Blend",

All you have to do is make like chef Caesar and mix them \nall together, and your conquest of dinner is complete.\n\nLike a certain other Caesar we can think of, you may be surprised at just how protean this salad can be-no \nneed to confine it to just a side.

However, we \nlike them best when employed as their name implies: as a consummate Conversation starter. Keep a jar on \nhand to idly snack on whenever a friend comes over to chat.

But given its widespread availability, how does one wade through the \nho-hum blends out there to find a high quality cuppa that boils up with the best of them? Why, step inside your \nneighborhood Trader Joe's, of course!\n\nTrader Joe's Organic Earl Grey Tea is a deceptively simple, organic blend of bold, full-bodied black tea from \nSouth India, balanced with an invigorating, floral black tea from Africa. The addition of oil from organic Italian \nBergamot oranges lends a citrusy, heady aroma (think of Bergamot as the Meyer lemon's warm, spicy cousin) \nand brightens the flavor of its black tea counterparts-this juxtaposition creates a smooth cup that's enjoyable \nno matter the time of day. (And if the time of day happens to be teatime, may we suggest serving Organic Earl \nGrey Tea alongside Curry Chicken Salad [sku 96426] sandwiches (crusts removed, of course), Mini Orange \nCranberry Tea Scones [sku 54051], and Lemon Bars [sku 93415]?)\n\nFor an expertly brewed cup of hot Earl Grey Tea, pour boiling water over a tea bag and brew for 3-5 minutes, \nthen remove the tea bag and add sweetener, or follow British tradition and serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon. \nIf you're on Team Iced Tea, the prep is similarly simple: pour four cups boiling water over 3-5 tea bags and steep \nfor 3-5 minutes, then remove tea bags and pour over ice-filled glasses. At $2.49 per 1.41-ounce box of 20 bags, \nthat's about 13\u00a2 per (hot or iced) cup-an unbeatable price for a cuppa of this quality. You'll find Organic Earl \nGrey Tea near the other boxed teas at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.\n\n10.08.\n18",

Of course, we went the extra mile by sourcing all organic ingredients and making \nthe recipe our very own. Organic soybean oil and white vinegar pair up with organic Romano cheese and \norganic egg to create a creamy feel and tangy taste. Then a host of organic seasonings, such as garlic powder, \nblack pepper, red bell peppers, oregano, basil, and tarragon add more zest and flavor. \n\nYou'll find that it brings your greens to life and also works well in a pasta salad. This dressing even doubles as \na marinade for chicken or seafood! We're selling each 12 fluid-ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Organic Italian \nDressing for $3.49.

(and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, \neither). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing \nthe sugar and balancing the smoke. We think we accomplished it, with a base of tomato puree, brown sugar \nand molasses for tang and sweetness, amped up with natural hickory smoke flavor. Onion powder and garlic \npowder add savory notes, rounded out by paprika and chipotle powder for a smoky finish. \n\nThis certified Organic BBQ Sauce is a nod to our tradition of striving to be better at what we do, everyday, and \nof introducing products that present an incredible value to our customers-which is exactly why we're selling \n18-ounce bottles of this new & improved, Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce for $2.69.

At Trader Joe's, our maple syrup is just that, a single \ningredient gift of the trees that adds deep sweetness and enormous joy everywhere it's poured. \n\nRight now we have Trader Joe's Organic Grade A Maple Syrup in two flavor/color designations - both \ndelicious, both pure maple, both with nothing added.  Organic Grade A Dark Color & Robust Taste is made \nlater in the season, when the sap coming from the trees has a lower sugar density and higher water content, \nand needs to be boiled for longer periods of time to ensure appropriate water evaporation. The longer cooking \ntime gives the syrup its darker color and richer flavor, which make it excellent as a baking ingredient, in a glaze \nfor meat & vegetables, in your coffee or tea, or in marinades & dressings. Organic Grade A Amber Color & Rich \nTaste is a lighter colored maple syrup that comes from sap that flows from the trees early in the season. It has \nthe light, straightforward maple flavor that's ideal for pancakes and waffles, an ice cream topper, or a yogurt or \noatmeal mix-in. \n\nOur Organic Grade A Maple Syrups come from the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec, source of more than 70% \nof the world's maple syrup.

That's impressive. And delicious. Pair it with our \nOrganic Tomato Basil Marinara [10111] or a simple blend of olive oil, garlic, and grated cheese.

Instead of using these chemicals, the South Korean farmers who grow \nthe seaweed for our Organic Seaweed Snack use two natural methods to control pests.

Just like standard spaghetti, the Abruzzese version is long and thin, made with \ndurum wheat semolina and water, but instead of having a rounded shape, this Spaghetti is uniquely square, \nand goes by the name Spaghetti alla Chitarra.\n\nA Chitarra is a pasta tool with a wooden frame and metal wires tied end-to-end, resembling a guitar (or \nchitarra in Italian.) Traditionally, a sheet of pasta dough is laid on the wires and pushed through with the \nuse of a rolling pin to create its shape. Our Italian supplier mimics this method with the use of a bronze die \nextruder, which not only delivers the requisite square shape, but also creates a rough exterior texture on each \nnoodle, resulting in superb sauce-sticking capabilities. Combine those attributes with a short list of exceptional \ningredients (our supplier mills their own organic durum wheat semolina), and you have Trader Joe's Organic \nSpaghetti alla Chitarra.\n\nAbout nine minutes in boiling water produces pleasingly al dente pasta, ready to enjoy with your favorite sauce. \nWe're partial to pairing this Spaghetti with a jar of Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce [sku 70839] or Cacio e \nPepe Pasta Sauce [sku 70650], topped with a generous grating of Pecorino Romano [sku 18326]. \n\nOrganic Spaghetti alla Chitarra Pasta",

To make the most of its super rich \nflavor profile and al dente texture, we recommend pairing with a crisp, dry white wine, perhaps even a nice \nsparkler.

To put it succinctly, it's a twist on a buttermilk short stack, baked into a \nsweet, moist loaf. But where's the fun in being succinct when you're talking about carbs?! The loaf itself is unbelievably \nmoist, with a golden-brown hue and a tender, cake-like crumb. We even use a bit of real maple syrup in the dough \nitself, so when you warm the Bread in your oven or toaster, you can invoke the Bread's namesake breakfast food \nwithout needing to bust out the griddle. \n\nBut wait-there's more! (We've always wanted to say that.) Each loaf of Pancake Bread is crowned with a layer of \nsweet, crumbly streusel, made with real butter, brown sugar and fragrant cinnamon-picture the glorious crumble \nthat accompanies a coffee cake, and you'll be on the right track. You may think we're gilding the loaf here (and \nthat may be true), but this maple-cinnamon breakfast flavor combo was just too good to pass up. Try a hearty slice \nof Pancake Bread with a glass of milk or hot cup of coffee, and you'll be hard-pressed to say otherwise. Each loaf \ncomes packaged in a sturdy, kraft paper tray with a re-closable lid, which helps it to maintain its moist texture, and \nwe've left it unsliced, which allows you to slice it as thick or thin as your heart desires. \n\nIn addition to being fond of bread and breakfast, we're also quite fond of great values-which is why we're offering \n15-ounce loaves of Trader Joe's Pancake Bread for the WOW price of $3.99 each.

And ladies and gentlefolks, let's just say that, like our whole lineup \nof luminaries, this Candle has good throw. Close your eyes, and you'll swear you're sitting on the steps of a \nsouthern front porch at sunset, sipping your peach iced tea in the warm summer breeze. But hurry - we \nsuspect the sun will set on our supply before summer's end...\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nPeach Black Tea Scented Candle",

This Tarte-building is all done by hand, so it's \nfree-form and unrefined-just how we like it. We bake each Tarte to sunny perfection-glistening orange in the \ncenter; golden brown at the edges-so that by the time it makes its way to you, all you have to do is heat it up. \n\nUnlike some frozen, fully-baked desserts, you can warm our Peaches & Cream Tarte in the oven or the \nmicrowave-just follow the instructions on the package. We recommend keeping a Peaches & Cream Tarte or \ntwo in your freezer at all times so that you're never caught unprepared for unexpected dinner guests, impromptu \ntea parties, and/or last-minute potlucks. Serve each warm slice with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of \nTJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576], and your dining companions will surely be wowed. \n\nA Tarte like this would easily sell for $11.99 and up in a fine p\u00e2tisserie.

Our supplier makes each batch with a base of tomato powder and granulated garlic to evoke \nthe flavor of tomato sauce, then finishes it with a suite of complementary herbs and spices like oregano, basil, \nand paprika to evoke a wide range of classic toppings. We recommend shaking it over hot french fries, roasted \ncauliflower, scrambled eggs, and creamy soups. Looking to bring a little pizza pizazz to your favorite snacks? \nThis Sprinkle goes great over popcorn, mini pretzels, and even our very own Saddle Chips [sku 62910]. No idea \nis too pie-in-the-sky when you've got Trader Joe's Pizza Sprinkle by your side!\n\nPizza Sprinkle\nSeasoning Blend",

These burgers are, more or less, a blend of the two.  \n\nWith multi-hued quinoa (red, white, and black) setting the stage, black beans, corn, red peppers, and plenty \nof seasonings are blended together and formed into a burger patty. They cook up to a captivatingly chewy \nconsistency, with just the right amount of crunch on the outside (not so crunchy if you cook them in the mi-\ncrowave). They work on a bun, like any other burger-ratchet up their Southwestern vibe with the addition of \nsliced avocado and salsa instead of the usual pickles and ketchup. Break them up into salads-a simple dress-\ning of salsa verde will do the trick here. Or just serve with a knife and fork and your favorite fixin's.\n\nWe're selling Quinoa Cowboy Veggie Burgers in a 12-ounce package of four burgers for $3.69, every day.  \nYou'll find them in our freezers.\n\n9.05.1\n4",

They're at their best when kept dry under refrigeration, and rinsed gently just before using. These \nplump red orbs are delicious eaten out of hand, and they also make for a stunning fruit tart. We're especially \nfond of them served on top of a big bowl of French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883]. \n\nDriscoll's Raspberries are known for their superior texture and flavor, and right now we're offering a 12-ounce \ncontainer of Driscoll's Raspberries, grown in Mexico and the coastal regions of Southern and Central \nCalifornia, for the terrific price of $4.99. Look for them in our fresh produce section.",

It takes a cheese made with rennet (as opposed to a cheese curdled \nwith acid) to be a melting cheese, and then it takes a cheese with a high water-to-fat ratio to be a good melting \ncheese.

Cultured milk is curdled, whey is drained, and water added in a process known as washing the curd. \nThis gives the Dutch Gouda its characteristic sweetness as it washes away some of the lactose, resulting in less \nacid throughout the cheese. Next the cheese moves to its molds which results in the Dutch Gouda's traditional \nshape and then is dried and given an annatto coating for its yellow hue and to prevent overdrying of the cheese. \nThe red waxed rind of a Gouda indicates a young cheese, like that of Trader Joe's Dutch Gouda.

Back when most people tended to prepare them by boiling them, Brussels sprouts had a general \nreputation for being mushy and unpleasant - and frozen Brussels sprouts fared even worse. It was only after \ncrispy, roasted and skillet-fried Brussels sprouts proliferated in restaurants nationwide that this brassica's \nstar began to rise again. Working hand in hand with a trusted supplier in France, we set out to capture that \nsame satisfyingly crisp texture in a frozen format, and we're proud to say that Trader Joe's Roasted Seasoned \nBrussels Sprouts passes the textural test with flying colors.\n\nIt turns out the secret is deceptively simple: our supplier slices the Sprouts in half, roasts them to a fine, \ntoothsome texture, then individually flash freezes them at the height of crispness before adding a suite of savory \nseasonings including garlic, parmesan, olive oil, salt, and pepper. With all that prep out of the way, effectively \nall that's separating you and this hearty side is heating it back up, either in the skillet or in the oven. After that, \nthey make a prime, steakhouse-style side for practically any protein. We find that they make a compellingly \nconvenient component for weekly meal prepping, too. Boy, what a difference a bit of texture makes!\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nRoasted Seasoned Brussels Sprouts",

They're simple chips, with three simple ingredients, and they're simply \ndelicious. On their own, dipped in virtually any dip, or even crushed and used as a breading for chicken (trust \nus here: yum!), these Chips are the real deal. \n\nOne of the benefits of the Trader Joe's label versus a national brand label is we're able to negotiate better pricing \nwhen we package products in our label. That holds true here. Have you shopped for chips elsewhere? They're \ncrazy expensive! But ours aren't. We're selling Trader Joe's Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt in a 16-ounce \nbag for $2.99, every day. That's a value that's a chip off the old Joe.",

Indeed, it's hard to beat a piece \nof perfectly ripened, mildly nutty, sharp Cheddar cheese, but it's not always easy to keep a source of sharp \nCheddar handy. That's where Trader Joe's Sharp Cheddar Cheese Snack Pack comes in: ten individually-\nwrapped, precisely-portioned slices of white Vermont Cheddar that work wonders for lunches, midday snacks, \nor anytime sharp Cheddar cravings.\n\nVermont Cheddar - recognizable from its trademark white hue, the result of Vermont cheesemakers eschewing \nthe use of anatto to color their Cheddars - is famous for its sharpness, and the Vermont Cheddar used in \nthis Snack Pack is no exception. In addition to being delightfully sharp and flavorful, each .75-ounce slice \nof Cheddar is pleasantly smooth and slightly creamy in texture, providing an elevated eating experience you \nwouldn't normally find in a pre-sliced cheese snack. Combine that with the fact that each slice comes pre-\nwrapped and ready to move, be it in your lunchbox, briefcase, or carry-on, and you'll find that these Snack \nPacks are sharp in more ways than one. \n\nEasy to transport and easy to enjoy, you could call Trader Joe's Sharp Cheddar Cheese Snack Packs the cutting \nedge of convenience. We think it's enough to call them a great deal: each 7.5-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Sharp \nCheddar Cheese Snack Packs (ten pieces per bag) sells for $3.49. Now that's sharp.

When dropped in the mouth, umami bombs detonate comforting, savory flavors. Trader \nMing's Shiitake Mushroom Chicken is our latest comestible bomb, and it's been artfully calibrated to bring \npeace to your palate.\n\nChunks of soy-sauce marinated, dark-meat chicken combine with Shiitake mushrooms, edamame (soy beans), \nand green beans. It's all saut\u00e9ed (during heating) in a ginger soy sauce. Chicken, mushrooms, and soy-each one \nrich in glutamates-explode with umami, devastating your tongue with nuclear pleasure. That's a good thing. \nEven more \"devastating,\" is the simple prep. Sauce and veggies come frozen in two separate packets; the chicken, \nloose in the larger package. Defrost the sauce packet in a bowl of hot water while you thaw the chicken and \nveggies for two to three minutes in the microwave. With a spot of cooking oil, saut\u00e9 it all together in a large fry \npan or wok for five to six minutes and you'll have a satisfying meal to keep the peace among hungry family-\nmembers.

You talked, we listened. If Almond Cheese \nseems a weird concept, just think about how common Almondmilk [sku 94740] has become in recent years. \nThis Almond Mozzarella Style Cheese starts in a similar way-by adding filtered water to crushed, raw, non-\nirradiated, organic, California almonds. (Tiny flecks of brown almond skin in this cheese assure you that we are \nusing whole, real almonds and not some synthetic, almond-ish alternative.)\n\nThis almond milk forms the cheese base, to which is added casein (milk protein that coagulates to form curds), \nalong with natural Parmesan cheese flavor. Obviously, this is not a vegan cheese, however it is 99% lactose free, \nwhich is great news for those who are lactose intolerant. Maybe the best news of all is the fact that our Almond \nMozzarella Style Shreds possess a wonderful nuttiness and a great texture that melts like real cheese. Try it on \nhomemade pizza with our Frozen Organic Pizza Crusts [sku 51242], Giotto's Pizza Sauce [sku 37333], and Volpi \nSliced Pepperoni [sku 38491].\n\nThe eight ounce bag of Trader Joe's Almond Mozzarella Style Shreds is $3.49, everyday.

This blend of olives produces oil that is light green in color and a bit fruity, with a refreshing \nverdant flavor. Use this oil in dressings or marinades or for dipping your favorite crusty bread.  \n\nIn addition to flavor, a big benefit of Spanish olive oil is value.

Botanically, it's more closely related to summer squashes like \nzucchini; its skin isn't as tough as it first appears, and when you cook it, the skin becomes barely detectable. \nBecause of this softer skin, Delicata doesn't store as well, or for as long, as other winter squash varieties, mak-\ning it an autumn treasure that's worth seeking out during its short tenure.\n\nBecause of its thin skin, Delicata Squash is easy to prepare in myriad ways. Its yellow-to-orange flesh is sweet, \nrich, and moist-so much so, in fact, that it's often called Sweet Potato Squash. It can be sliced lengthwise, \nseeds scooped out, and roasted, much like you'd do with an acorn or butternut squash. It can also be sliced \ninto rounds (seeds removed from centers), seasoned simply with salt and pepper (or maple syrup or brown \nsugar) and baked. There's no need to peel-once cooked, it's easy to eat the skin. This particular squash also \nsteams well, and can be cooked in the microwave to applause-worthy result. Also applause-worthy is our price \nof 99 cents for each Trader Joe's Delicata Squash.

In actuality, this Squash sometimes cleverly \nknown as \"squaghetti,\" was simply named for its cooked texture, which resembles long, thin noodles.\n\nWhether you motivation is ample nude figures in Flemish Renaissance paintings, or just the inability to fit into \nthe jeans you wore last fall, Spaghetti Squash does provide a healthy and yummy, seasonal alternative to the \ntypical plate of carbs.\n\nTo create a spaghetti substitute plate, simply cook your Squash until tender. Microwaving for 5-10 minutes \nworks just fine, but you can also bake it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes, or until soft. After it cools a little, \ncarefully cut the softened Spaghetti Squash in half lengthwise, remove the seeds, and use a fork to loosen the \nspaghetti-like fibers that have emerged during cooking. Next, lightly saut\u00e9 the \"squaghetti\" with a little oil in a \npan on the stovetop. This will allow some of the excess moisture to steam off. Finally, put it in a bowl and top \nwith your favorite pasta sauce!\n\nAs we enter the season of holiday feasts, here's a meal that is not only delicious, but that can also serve to bal-\nance out all those extra helpings of potatoes and stuffing that you know you're going to have.

After \nthat, it's just a matter of giving them a quick pan-sear with butter and lemon juice, a few minutes under the \nbroiler with garlic and olive oil, or just enough time on the grill, threaded through skewers, until opaque on \nboth sides.

Over time, \nthis one-pan dish has evolved to include a variety of different ingredients. Probably the most popular version \nworldwide (and the second most popular in Spain) is paella de marisco, after which we've patterned Trader Joe's \nSeafood Paella.\n\nThough not Valencian (or Spanish), our supplier isn't far from paella's origins. They are located about 1,400 \nmiles away, on the northwestern coast of France-perfectly positioned for assembling Seafood Paella. We took \nadvantage of their ocean expertise, loading up this Paella with 32% Seafood, including shrimp, calamari rings, \nand mussels. In place of beans, we include peas, fried onions, and a trio of peppers-red, yellow, and green. The \nseafood and veggies are nestled into sunny-yellow, short-grain, white rice that derives its color from naturally \navailable ingredients (namely turmeric and saffron). All the flavors are woven together by our very own paella \nspice mix, which includes paprika, saffron, garlic, onion, and chili pepper.\n\nThere's a lot of preparation that goes into making paella from scratch, but thankfully, with our Seafood Paella, \nyou barely have to move a mussel (or shrimp or squid).

Sliced cheese like Trader Joe's Sliced Sharp \nCheddar.  \n\nTrader Joe's Sliced Sharp Cheddar is made for us under the supervision of two Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers, \nusing milk from local family farms. It's a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored \"cheddaring\" \nprocess first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional \ncheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they've been cut and turned. It's a time and \nlabor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more \"modern\" \ncheddaring methods like stirring the curds.\n\nThe flavor and texture of Cheddar changes dramatically as it ages, to our eternal delight. Our Sliced Sharp \nCheddar is aged four to six months, just enough time to develop its rich, creamy, nutty flavor and almost-but-\nnot-quite-ready-to-crumble texture. This complexity makes it an ideal mate for a burger, and it's also excellent \nin cold sandwiches, panini, tuna melts, and omelets. Each slice is separated by parchment, making it easy to \nuse and ideal for anytime at all. We're selling each 12 ounce package of 12 slices for $3.99, every day.

The seeds add flavor and texture, setting \nTrader Joe's Soyaki quite apart from the crowd. Remember to give the bottle a good shake before using - this \nwill ensure the seeds are dispersed throughout the sauce, ensuring maximum seed exposure and an excellent \nSoyaki experience.\n\nTry Trader Joe's Soyaki as a marinade for chicken, beef, pork or shrimp - the slightly sweet flavor of the sauce \nis equally delicious grilled, broiled, pan saut\u00e9ed or baked. Use it as a stir-fry sauce for veggies and tofu. It makes \na good dip for gyoza or shu mai.

The paste is sweet and smooth, delicately grapey, \nwith a gentle, pliable texture and mild fruity flavor.  \n \nSheep's milk makes up the dominant \ncheeses in Spain, due to centuries of vast \nherds of sheep covering much of Spain. \nThe most popular cheese is Manchego, \nproduced in La Mancha. Manchego has a \nfirm and compact consistency and a \nbuttery texture with a distinctive flavour. \nIt is well developed but not too strong, \ncreamy with a slight piquancy. It is a \nclassic flavor of Spain. Iberico is a blend \nof cows' sheep's and goats's milk which \ngives this cheese its smooth and complex \nflavor.

In short, cooking time is shortened, and the done bird is moister (breasts don't overcook while the rest of \nthe bird finishes), with lots of nice, evenly crisp skin.\n\nWhile Spatchcocking isn't necessarily brain surgery, it does take some extra work in the kitchen, which some \nfeel negates the time you save actually cooking the bird. Trader Joe's negates this negation by providing a fully \nSpatchcocked Chicken, ready to grill or roast. Not only is it already 'butterflied' for you, it is also pre-seasoned; \nsoaked in a brine with orange and lime juices, and marinated in extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, \nparsley, and lemon slices.\n\nRemove Trader Joe's Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken from its package (leave the lemon slices in \ntact and don't rinse it), and put it on a pre-heated grill skin-side down until it's well-browned and its internal \ntemperature reaches 165\u00baF on a meat thermometer. Alternately, you can lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking \npan and cook at 375\u00baF in your oven for about an hour. (Cooking time varies according to the size of your bird.)\n\nWe've enthusiastically dispatched two-and-a-half to three-pound Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chickens \nto all our Trader Joe's locations, where you can snatch your own for $3.99 per pound.

These curds are then pressed into firm tofu squares, which are subsequently \nmarinated in spicy Sriracha for 12 hours and finally baked to perfectly textured, flavor-filled tofu. The long \nmarinating process allows the tofu to absorb the sauce's fiery spiciness and it's subtle sweetness, along with a \nhint of garlic for an added depth of flavor. It also creates a red and white marbling that is as striking, as it is \nfiery-delicious.\n\nCut open the package and enjoy the Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu just as it is-it's cooked and ready to enjoy. \nTry it with our Organic Herb Salad Mix [sku 50066].

Trader Joe's Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of \nChinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile. \n\nThis concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long \nBao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly \nmake this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms \ntheir wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each \ndumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth-broth made from ingredients includ-\ning chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao \nmeans \"wrapped\" in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo \nsteamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.\n\nTo enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at \nleast another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful! We suggest \nplacing a hot Soup Dumpling on a deep Chinese soup spoon and nibbling a little hole in the side to let the soup \nrun out before enjoying soup and dumpling together.\n\nYou get six large Chicken Soup Dumplings in each six ounce package for $2.99.

In \nEnglish-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup \n(and therefore must be eaten carefully!)  While the original at Trader Joe's is chicken-based, xiao long bao are \ntraditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers actually adheres closer to culinary tradition.\n\nWhere we've veered most from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor \nplayer.

Yams purchased in the United \nStates are almost always sweet potatoes.  Look for sweet potatoes that are firm and do \nnot have bruises, soft spots or cracks.  Store in a cool dry place and do not refrigerate, \nas cold temperatures alter the flavor and shorten the shelf life of the yam. \n\nTaste:  Sweet and wholesome, with a rich nutty flavor. \n\nUses: Sweet Potatoes are an extremely versatile vegetable.  They can be baked, \nroasted, fried, grilled, boiled, mashed or grated.  Make Sweet Potato biscuits, stuffing, \nsoup, pie, casserole.  Or you can sweeten them by baking and adding a little butter or \nmaple syrup, and topping them off with some brown sugar! \n\nNutritional Benefits: Some refer to Sweet Potatoes as a super food because of their \nnutritional value.

To that last point, we \nrecently had a chance to try their new, fresh Pulled Pork Tamales, and we're elated to announce that they, too, \ntotally hit the mark. We were so delighted with their perfectly-textured masa, tantalizingly tender pulled pork, \nand superbly spiced red sauce that we decided then and there to add them to our deli case. \n\nCedarLane\u00ae Pulled Pork Tamales are easy to prepare (simply wrap in a damp paper towel and microwave on \nhigh for 90 to 120 seconds), easy to modify (top with your favorite salsa, shredded cheese, or sour cream-or \nall three!), and even easier to enjoy. While the pulled pork is the clear star of the show, we'd be remiss not to \nshine a spotlight on the savory, lightly spicy red sauce, which uses a combination of tomatoes, garlic, onion, \nand guajillo, ancho, and chipotle peppers to extraordinary effect. Best of all? A 20-ounce pack of CedarLane\u00ae \nPulled Pork Tamales, each containing four Tamales, sells for $6.99, every day.

With just a minimalist mix of peanuts, almonds, \nraisins, and candy-coated milk chocolate gems, every bite contains a remarkable medley of flavors and textures, \nwhich is why it's remained a solid gold hit with our customers for nearly 25 years. So how does one celebrate \nsuch a bar-setting snack? How about by recontextualizing it into a new setting: a highly snackable Bar? \n\nProudly made with the same constituent components as the Trail Mix that inspired it,  Trader Joe's Rainbow's \nEnd Trail Mix Bars are held together with a bit of tapioca syrup and a rich coating of dipped dark chocolate on \nthe base. Like its predecessor, each Bar offers a nice mix of crunchiness from the roasted peanuts and almonds, \na bit of tenderness from the plump raisins, and some fun, flavorful sweetness from the candy-coated milk \nchocolate, all of which is captivatingly complemented by the dark chocolate layer. We find it's ideal for enjoying \nbefore work or school, during a hike or long car ride, or after a run or gym day.  \n\nRainbow's End Trail Mix Bars",

And it's really just \nsomething you're going to want to put on\u00bf everything. \n\nTo create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with kosher salt, and used a flavor base of porcini \nand white button mushrooms - earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is \nwhy we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & \nblack pepper, and thyme. If you follow an eating plan like Paleo or Whole 30, this type of seasoning is \na staple. If you follow an eating plan like we do, also known as Anything and Everything, Trader Joe's \nMushroom & Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend will elevate the flavors of Anything \nand Everything, a sprinkle at a time.\n\nWe're selling each 2.1 ounce jar of Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company Multipurpose Umami \nSeasoning Blend for $2.99, significantly less than we've seen similar products selling for elsewhere.

Open up the 14.1-ounce can, drain, and roughly cut the \ntomatoes to use as a homemade pizza topping. Or pop them in the blender to create a base for a fresh Mexican-\nstyle salsa.

Vesuvius in the rich volcanic soils of Villagio Marzano \nsul Sarno. These were the forerunners of today's \"San Marzano\" tomatoes (supposedly), but it's hard to know \nwhat's really true-especially when one considers that Peru had no kingdom (or king!) two hundred years ago.\n\nThat truth may be lost to the past, but the taste of Trader Joe's Heavenly Villagio Marzano\u00ae Tomatoes is a truth \nthat is right here before us. With an oblong shape and vaguely pointed ends-these tomatoes are a miniature \nversion of the original San Marzano variety. The deep red fruit has smooth skin that yields a pleasant 'pop' \nwhen bitten. Inside, there is more flesh than seeds, and a flavor that is slightly sweet, and not too acidic. Such a \n\"heavenly\" profile comes, not from the volcanic soils of the Campania region of Italy, but rather from hothouses \nlocated in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe small size of our Heavenly Villagio Marzanos\u00ae makes them perfect for snacking. Sliced in half, they add \njuicy charm to a green salad. Diced and simmered with olive oil, garlic and basil, they live up to their heritage \nas the best of the best sauce tomatoes.\n\nOne of the happiest verifiable truths of all is that our hothouse harvest of Trader Joe's Heavenly Villagio \nMarzano Tomatoes is ongoing and unlimited (unlike the brief, two month harvest of San Marzanos in Italy). \nIn other words, they're available year-round!

And if you'll allow us to toot our own horn for a moment, our new \nRestaurant Style White Corn Tortilla Chips really hit the mark. \n\nWe start with fresh, white corn tortillas (yes, actual tortillas-we're working far and above the tortilla chip \nstandard here, folks) that are cut into slightly larger, slightly thicker triangles and fried in vegetable oil until \nthey're ultra-crispy. The frying process creates a durable crunch that stands up to the even the chunkiest of \nguacs and heartiest of nacho fixings. And it's not just their heartiness that makes our White Corn Tortilla Chips \n\"restaurant style\"-we also add a touch of sea salt and lime juice concentrate. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 aut\u00e9ntico! \n\nEnjoy Restaurant Style White Corn Tortilla Chips straight out of the bag or alongside some fresh ceviche. \nUse them in your abuela's famous chilaquiles recipe or in a classic chicken & tortilla chip casserole. Or, take the \nroad most traveled and use 'em as a vehicle for your favorite TJ's dip-Chunky Spicy Guacamole Aut\u00e9ntico [sku \n96621], Homestyle Salsa Especial [sku 57152], Three Layer Hummus [sku 80867], etc.\u00bf\n\nWe're selling each 9-ounce bag of Restaurant Style White Corn Tortilla Chips for just $1.99-you'll find them \nin our snack aisle. \n\n01.09.\n17",

Or in your hands. \n\nWe've yet to see a 32 ounce bottle of organic cold brew coffee concentrate sell for anything less than $12-and \nmost brands retail for closer to $14 a bottle. But we're not \"most brands,\" so we're selling each 32 ounce bottle of \nTrader Joe's Organic French Roast Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate for $9.99, every day-that's about 83\u00a2 per \n12-ounce cup of coffee you make with it.

At the risk of exhibiting outright \nhubris, we've raised the bar in so many ways we hardly know where to begin. \n\nSo let's begin with the grains. Granola bars generally begin with oats, and Dark Chocolate Chunk \nRaises the Bar is no exception. Where others begin and end with oats, that's simply where Raises the \nBar begins. We've added millet, quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat to the oats-a quartet of ancient \ngrains that deliver great texture and nuttiness-plus, the addition of rich Dark Chocolate Chunks. \n\nWe've also managed to keep the overall sugar to 8 grams per bar by using a blend of cane sugar, tapioca \nsyrup, honey, and brown rice syrup-the Bars are sweet (but not too sweet), charmingly chewy, and \neven gluten free! Wash them down with a glass of milk or pair them with a pack of Handful of Raw \nAlmonds [sku 91920] for a nice-sized snack to fuel you through the day.\n\nRaises the Bar will surpass your granola bar expectations, and perhaps position themselves as standard \nbearers for future granola greatness. We're selling each 6.2 ounce box of five, 1.2 ounce, individually \nwrapped Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Chunk Raises the Bars for $2.79.\n\n08.08.\n16",

The high growing \nregions of Bahia, Brazil aren't blessed with such conditions, so growers send their beans away to sunnier \nregions-this journey is where the Tropical Bahia Brazil magic happens.\n\nRipe Arabica coffee beans spend the long drive in a hot, closed truck.

But, while our pieces of chicken or cheese cooked in Indian curry may keep \ncarnivores and vegetarians grinning, the vegan who craves Indian food has had little reason to smile\u00bf until \nnow\u00bf\n\nDetermined not to discriminate against discriminating palates of any determination, we cooked up \nTrader Joe's Vegan Tikka Masala. (Truthfully, it's probably less about the need to curb any kind of vegan \ndiscrimination, and more about the earnest desire to share our delicious Masala with all.) One of our Indian \nsuppliers, located in New Jersey, has been making Trader Joe's Masala for years. The difference this time is \nthat they've used soy protein in place of chicken or cheese. This \"meatless meat\" (developed by a Taiwanese \nsupplier), comes so close to lamb in its texture, you may find it hard to tell the difference. It's bathed in a spicy \n(but not too hot), tomato and coconut-milk sauce that is expertly flavored with onions, garlic, cashews, and \nspices, and presented on a bed of cumin-flavored Basmati rice. Just heat (in the microwave or conventional \noven) and eat (in your mouth).\n\nWe believe this 9.5-ounce vegan entr\u00e9e is an incredible value at $3.49-proving once again that the only two \nthings against which Trader Joe's will ever discriminate are: low quality and high prices. Find this and a host of \nother values (vegan and otherwise) everyday in our freezer case.\n\n2.05.1\n5",

Growing \nolder, we learn that though rules may seem restrictive, they often allow for excellent results. In the case of \nStilton, it's precisely the strict production requirements that ensure this world-class cheese is always a pleasure \nto taste-not to mention being easy to swallow.\n\nOur White Stilton with Apricots adheres to the same requirements as the famous Blue to earn its \"Stilton\" \ndesignation: It's produced for us in Cropwell Bishop, a village in Nottinghamshire-one of only three English \ncounties approved for Stilton production. It's made only from locally pasteurized cow's milk. It's formed into a \ncylindrical shape-but not pressed-and its crust is naturally formed. Where this White differs from its Blue \ncousin is in what's inside. Eschewing the friendly blue-green fungus, our White Stilton contains something \nthat is arguably more palatable: real bits of apricots.\n\nVisually, it's stunning. Bits of dried fruit appear throughout - easy compliments to the creamy, crumbly texture \nof the cheese. The infusion of dried apricot conveys a sweet and fruity taste. Our White Stilton with Apricots \nis fabulous when crumbled on a salad, or melted on a steak. It presents well on a cheeseboard with walnuts, \nfresh pears, or other dried fruits. It pairs equally well with a glass of dessert Port, fruity Riesling, spiced \nGew\u00fcrztraminer, or a dry Sauvignon Blanc.\n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nWhite Stilton Cheese with Apricots",

  "item_story_qil": "Trader Joe's Organic Vodka Sauce is, to be sure, a tomato sauce. But it's a tomato sauce with a bit of an edge, \nan attitude all on it's own. Yes, it's made with actual vodka. Organic Vodka, actually. In fact, all of its simple \ningredients are organic, from the tomatoes to the cheeses, and the cream to the herbs. The sauce is slightly \ncreamy, has some nuttiness from the Parmesan cheese, and even delivers a little vodka-tinged kick (just a little; \nthis sauce is suitable for all ages). Our Organic Vodka Sauce is perfect over any kind of pasta; it's a particularly \ngood partner to our Organic Brown Rice Quinoa Fusilli [sku 51524] with your choice of protein, as it adds a \nlayer of complexity to your pasta dinner, but doesn't overwhelm the pasta's unique flavors. For an even heartier \nmeal, add cooked, diced chicken and broccoli to the hot sauce and serve over your favorite pasta. You'll find \neach 25-ounce jar in on our grocery shelves. \n\n *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.\n\nOrganic Vodka Pasta Sauce",

Such successes have inspired us to venture into the music \nindustry, which is why we decided to turn one of our new items into its own rock band: Trader Joe's presents \nthe Crispy Crunchy Mochi Rice Nuggets!\n\nWe discovered these tasty little Nuggets in an airport in Japan and instantly fell in love. They're made in Japan \nfrom the same glutinous rice as mochi, a chewy rice paste. Steamed rice is mechanically kneaded until turned \ninto a silky smooth paste, and then stretched into long ropes, cut into pieces and dried. The small squares are \nfried, which puffs them up, and then tossed in sea salt. The resulting addictive, savory squares are truly the \nrock stars of the snack aisle.\n\nSuper crunchy snack superstars deserve celebrity treatment-which, here, looks strangely like snacking. \nStraight out of the bag is the simplest, most straightforward way to go. Mix with Honey Sesame Cashews [sku \n57068] for a D.I.Y. trek mix of sorts, or enjoy alongside Wasabi Seaweed Snacks [sku 95840]. If you're feeling \nexceptionally partial to mochi, you could always alternate between bites of Mochi Rice Nuggets and Mochi Ice \nCream (Green Tea [sku 44142], Chocolate [sku 44144], or Strawberry [sku 44143]).\n\nFor only $2.99 for a 6.35 ounce bag, you can experience the rockin' good snack that is Trader Joe's Crispy \nCrunchy Mochi Rice Nuggets. At a value (and taste) that's music to anyone's ears (and taste buds), they'll \nquickly be your new favorite performer\u00bferr\u00bfsnack. \n\n12.05.\n16",

   "description": "Ubiquitous in Medieval kitchens, the almond-based beverage served as a trusty substitute for animal milks, as it was easier to keep fresh, suitable for religious fast days and promised plentiful proteins and natural fats (in fact, they'd even churn butter out of the nutty, milk-like liquid). Much has changed since the Middle Ages - refrigerators exist and pasteurization of milks is standard practice - but almond beverage remains a steadfast dairy substitute. We've carried two almond beverages in our dairy case that have proven exceptionally popular - original (sweetened) & vanilla. Adding an Non- Dairy Almond Beverage seemed appropriately Medieval. We work with a family-owned company, who've been crafting quality beverages for 40 years and use only the finest, carefully selected, California-grown almonds. The almonds are first soaked and then finely ground, before being blended with water, until a creamy, milk-like consistency is obtained. Strained to remove any skin or almond pieces, it's a smooth, rich- tasting beverage that carries a hint of the nuts' natural sweetness with less than 1 gram of sugar per serving. Dairy free, soy free & gluten free, this vegan beverage is exceptionally versatile. Pour it over cereal, mix it in pancakes, add it to smoothies, use it to make cream sauces & dressings or go Medieval - make some butter. Trader Joe's Unsweetened Almond Beverage is a true classic, especially at our great price of $2.99 for each half gallon.",

   "description": "It would be difficult to overstate how far vegan alternatives to dairy have come in just a few short years. For instance, it wasn't too long ago that the idea of a totally dairy-and-lactose-free whipping cream was either entirely out of the question, or came with considerable compromise-perhaps it would have the right flavor, but wasn't quite whippable, perhaps it had the right consistency, but the taste was all wrong. Not so today. In fact, today, you can pick up a carton of Trader Joe's Vegan Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative with absolute confidence that it will taste, feel, and, crucially, whip, just like its dairy-based counterpart. As with its plant-derived predecessors Trader Joe's Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative [sku 70942] and Trader Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread [sku 71782], the secret behind this Vegan Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative lies largely in the ingenuity of its recipe. Our supplier, an expert in non-dairy staples based in Germany, employs a carefully balanced mix of vegetable-based oils, starches, and proteins to provide just the right consistency and rich, creamy flavor to make this a direct, one-to-one replacement for dairy-based whipping cream. As such, we can whole-heartedly recommend it as an ingredient in soups, sauces, and desserts, as a mix-in for coffee, tea, or cocoa, and, when whipped until light and fluffy, a topping for milkshakes, mousses, or sweet breakfast treats.

So much so, in fact, that we decided the time was right to expand on the smooth, easy- going flavor of our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage [sku 65333] with a vanilla-tinged variant. Made for us by the same supplier as our original version, Trader Joe's Unsweetened Vanilla Non-Dairy Oat Beverage differs from its predecessor in two crucial ways: first, of course, is the light touch of vanilla that's present in every sip. Second, instead of fully hydrolyzing the starches in the oats into sugar, our supplier only lets them break down partially, resulting in a drink that's not only free of added sugar, but in fact contains a total zero grams of sugar per serving. Oat-standing! Ideal for mixing into smoothies, pouring over breakfast cereals, or creating a super oat-powered batch of overnight oats, our vegan, gluten free Unsweetened Vanilla Non-Dairy Oat Beverage's silky texture and delicate vanilla notes are especially suited for sweeter endeavors. We recommend adding a splash to your morning coffee, tea, or cold brew for a little extra body. And if you're simply looking for something smooth and satisfying, but never overly sweet, a tall glass of ice-cold Unsweetend Vanilla Oat Beverage is always a great idea.

   "description": "Toast sounds simple, and in a way, it is simple. But, when you consider that the source of good toast is really good bread, it suddenly sounds not so simple after all. After testing a wide variety of contenders, we've come to the unanimous decision that the very best bread for toast-making is sourdough. And because toast requires slices of bread, our conclusion also included the rationale that sliced Sourdough is the most practical Sourdough for this particular endeavor. And thus, Trader Joe's Sourdough Bread tops our list of \"Best Breads for Toast\" for this and every year. Our Sourdough Bread is made exclusively for us, and will be slightly different depending on where in Trader Joe's country you pick up your loaf - the flavor of Sourdough depends largely on the \"starter,\" which is a living culture that lends the bread its signature sour profile. Because every starter is different, every bakery produces a slightly different flavor profile. If you visit a Trader Joe's in Tennessee, your Sliced Sourdough toast will be just a bit different from the Sourdough toast you make with the Sourdough you buy in San Francisco. What they all have in common is their excellence - especially when toasted. So slather on some butter, a bit of jam, or make a PB&J on Sourdough toast. You may even take that toasting to a higher level, and make a scrumptious grilled cheese¿ on Sourdough. Toast away. You'll be glad you did. We're selling each 24-ounce loaf of Trader Joe's Sourdough Bread for $2.99, every day. You'll find it on our bakery racks.",

In North America, however, bread sticks are almost their diametic opposite: wide, soft, and often accentuated with savory seasonings and cheese. Trader Joe's Garlic & Cheese Bread Sticks are firmly of the North American kind, meaning they have a luxuriously soft texture, with garlic, other aromatic spices, and a blend of four cheeses baked right in. Don't get us wrong: grissini have their place (we've sold them before and almost certainly will again!) but when you want something soft, savory, and cheesy, these Bread Sticks are hard to beat. A consummate companion to pizza, pasta, soups, and salads, Trader Joe's Garlic & Cheese Bread Sticks are delicious right out of the package, but even more so when heated up in an oven for a few minutes right before serving. Each batch is made with a mix of grated Parmesan, Romano, mozzarella and Cheddar, ensuring that each bite is satisfyingly cheesy. In addition to their use as a side, they also make a great appetizer when served with warm marinara for dipping-a little like straightened out garlic knots, if you will.

Bagel Josef 's Plain Bagels are really good bagels, made for us using quality ingredients and without the use of artificial preservatives or dough conditioners. The secret to their bagel excellency is their baking process. First, the dough is proofed in high humidity and then set out to slowly ferment, which brings out all of the dough's delicious, subtle flavors. Next, the bagels are kettle-boiled-fully submerged in boiling water to lock in that chewy center and create that perfect \"skin.\" Finally, they're off to the hearth tunnel oven to be baked until they've acquired that perfect, golden-brown bagel crust. Toast your Bagel, slather it with Cream Cheese [sku 12491], and top it with Smoked Salmon [sku 13059] and Capers [sku 24654].

After all, you can make a sandwich out of just about anything with a pita-in fact, if you know the secret of the pockets, every piece of pita can make two good-sized sandwiches! The secret to making this edible pocket lies in the baking: the bread is baked at very high temperatures, creating the \"puff \" that eventually makes a pocket. Pockets are always useful, but they're especially wonderful when you can fill them with your favorite foods. Put a few pieces of Falafel [sku 93935] and some Tzaziki Sauce [sku 24883] sauce in the pocket and you've got yourself a delicious Middle Eastern meal. If you're in the mood for a salad but don't have time to sit and eat, why not take your salad and put it inside a pita?

But, for those who want a ready-to-top crust from our bakery shelves, look no further than Trader Giotto's Pizza Crust.

What makes this flour particularly suited to pizza crust is the fact that it's been refined to what the Italian pizzaiolos call '00' flour. This ultra-refined flour has a powdery-soft consistency that helps create a light, crisp exterior that's tender to the bite. Olive oil in the dough contributes authentic flavor, as does our supplier's natural fermentation process, yielding that yeasty \"bite\" pizza-lovers crave. Of course, you can further customize the flavor with whatever toppings you wish.

The tapioca flour-derived from the root of the cassava plant from South America-helps provide some of the crispness and chew that's often missing in other gluten free breads. This bread is great for breakfast, toasted with a spread of butter (or a bit of Trader Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread [sku 71782], to keep it totally vegan). Of course, it's also great with a variety of fruit or nut spreads, or try it egg-battered and pan-fried for a delicious French toast. Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread",

We assure you, Trader Joe's Dark Pumpernickel Tuscan Pane is no nickel-and-dime bread. It's actually a momentous everyday product just waiting to be embraced-and eaten-by you. Pumpernickel rye bread originated in Westphalin, Germany. Since making its way around the world, pumpernickel bread has won acclaim for its slight sweetness and heavier, denser texture. For our Dark Pumpernickel Tuscan Pane, our supplier uses a 100% rye starter with course ground rye and wheat flours. The dough is hand shaped by expert bread-shapers, and then baked on a stone hearth to produce a perfectly chewy interior and crisp exterior. Slices of our Dark Pumpernickel Tuscan Pane shine in just about any culinary creation you can dream up. It's great for making that Reuben sandwich you've been craving-pumpernickel, after all, was thought to be the original bread used for the famous sandwich. Or, throw some avocado and Havarti Cheese Slices [sku 78745] on a few slices for a tasty vegetarian lunch option. Any way you slice it-or, prepare it, since this bread comes sliced-this chewy, flavorful bread will not disappoint. The value won't disappoint, either.

Well, for starters it means that our Buyers really do travel the world in search of products that excite, delight, and inspire. (Yes, it's a great gig.) Sometimes, they set sail with a particular product in mind; other times, they head out in search of sheer inspiration. Here, it was a bit of both-while our Buyer didn't head to France this time to specifically develop a private label Chocolate Chip Pain Au Lait, she had been inspired on previous visits to find a vendor to produce an authentic Pain Au Lait worthy of our bakery racks. \"Worthy\" is the key word here, though, and we were pleased as pain to introduce our plain Pain Au Lait [sku 60336] last fall. Now, with the help of that same French supplier and their time-honored family recipe, we're here to sweeten the deal, with Trader Joe's Chocolate Chip Pain Au Lait. It's that same heavenly Trader Joe's Pain Au Lait, but with rich, dark chocolate chips throughout. Pain Au Lait translates directly to \"Milk Bread,\" a humble name for these slightly sweet, elegant, brioche-like rolls.

Technically speaking, they're slightly spongy (picture a sourdough-like texture), puck-shaped pieces of bread, horizontally bisected into two, equal, circular halves. And, being that they're gluten free, they're made from a blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and chickpea flour rather than the regular, wheat-based stuff. Each Muffin has a toothsome exterior (more of a \"skin\" than a \"crust,\" though), and an interior filled with plenty of...well, lest we infringe upon on any trademarks, we'll say they're filled with plenty of \"pockets & crevices.\" Yes, that's it.

   "description": "We're not the types to say this kind of thing cavalierly, so believe us when we say that we may have found the greatest thing since sliced bread: Trader Joe's Sliced Cinnamon Raisin Bread! Made for us by a trusted bakery partner, each loaf contains a sweet, faintly spicy swirl of cinnamon sugar, and is studded with juicy, ever-so- slightly tart raisins throughout. Once baked, our supplier cuts the loaf into thin, easy-to-portion slices that can be enjoyed for their super soft texture as-is, right out of the package, or toasted until they're lightly browned and satisfyingly crisp. Sweet, cinnamon-y, and punctuated with occasional pops of flavor from the rich, juicy raisins, Trader Joe's Sliced Cinnamon Raisin Bread is sure to bring a bravura performance to the breakfast table. It serves excellently as a simple slice of toast, with a bit of butter or your favorite non-dairy spread. It's great for making thin and crisp slices of French toast that pair especially well with warm Maple Syrup [sku 04892] and Organic Powdered Sugar [sku 59227]. And for an intriguing mix of savory and sweet, try it as a sandwich bread with bacon, a fried egg, and a crispy Hashbrown [sku 94769] patty. Sliced Cinnamon Raisin Bread",

Since we use local bakeries, this baking process varies from region to region-nevertheless, you'll find every iteration to be wonderfully doughy inside, with a good chew on the outside. These Bagels are also Everything because they're topped with traditional Everything seasonings, including sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, onion, and salt.

From worldy matters to deciding what to eat for dinner (Trader Joe's being the obvious answer for that one), we could all use a little more togetherness. Thankfully, our product developers have reached a consensus and decided the best way to bring a little agreement among us all is... drum roll... cookies! Trader Joe's Half Moon Cookies, to be specific. The POTUS had the right idea when at a bakery he was visiting back in 2008 he personally dubbed a batch of half moon cookies \"unity cookies.\" Such presidential action serves to confirm our theory: Nothing brings more harmony than people sharing sweet, circular snacks. (That may be a tad hyperbolic, but really, who doesn't love cookies?!) With Trader Joe's Half Moon Cookies, we all get to experience unity, firsthand. Each moist, cake-like vanilla cookie agrees wonderfully with the smooth, chocolate and vanilla icings that share its cookie-top. The half- moon visual suggests a yin-yang oneness, as does the alluring, vanilla-cocoa aroma. Our supplier in Brooklyn, New York must have wanted as many people as possible to share in these wonderfully handcrafted cookies, since they're certified kosher (pareve) and low in sodium (30mg per cookie). Even the cookies themselves are pros when it comes to co-operation: Our Half Moon Cookies pair naturally with coffee, tea, milk...

The sugar cookie dough used to make these Stars is based on the famous Linzertorte from Linz, Austria. It's rolled and, during this time of year, cut into fabulous stars. Because two star cookies are better than one, we then take two of these stars and unite them together using a sweet, seedless raspberry jam made from Meeker raspberries. These kosher-certified star sandwiches are finished off with a generous sprinkling of coarse sugar. Twinkle, twinkle, Raspberry Stars. These celestial-inspired treats are ready to be the star of your next holiday dessert tray or your new favorite holiday cookie. Each 16-ounce box of Trader Joe's Raspberry Stars is $4.99, throughout this holiday season. 11.20. 17",

   "description": "As dessert trends go, it seems that the more outlandish the creation, the less focus there is on the taste and enjoyment of the dish at hand (bespangled, unicorn-inspired baked goods come to mind)-not to mention the fact that such famed food fads are often accompanied by an equally outlandish price tag. Preferring to proffer pastries that deliver on both quality and price, our product developers continuously work to separate the wheat from the chaff in the trendy dessert world, to bring only the best to our bakery shelves-desserts like Trader Joe's Brookie. Made for us by an Ohio baker with a reputation for brownie brilliance, Trader Joe's Brookie is a mouth- watering mash-up of two timeless desserts. The bottom layer is all brownie-a rich dark brown batter, with sweetly fragrant cocoa notes and a pleasantly fudgy chew. That beautiful brownie batter is topped with a layer of golden cookie batter that's speckled with sweet chocolate chips, and the whole thing is baked to perfection-in this case, perfection is defined as a slightly soft, tender center with a gloriously chewy edge. And because this rectangular bar of Brookie goodness is conveniently pre-cut into eight servings, you'll get a sweet, soft center and chewy edge, no matter which piece you eat. Speaking of eating, Trader Joe's Brookie is a two-in-one treat that can fly solo as a sweet snack, or share the limelight warmed up, alongside a simple scoop of TJ's Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883]- no glitter required. We're selling each 11-ounce package for $3.99, two dollars lower than trendy bakery prices. 11.26. 18",

Yes, it's a necessity at the Thanksgiving table, and you have to have a fruit pie on the Fourth of July, but otherwise, it's a category of dessert we wish would appear more often. And this is why we're proponents of making pie apart of your everyday life. To help you do that, we offer you Trader Joe's Apple Crumble Pie. Before actually baking our Apple Crumble Pies, our supplier first grows the apples used in the Pies. That's commitment. Northern Spy apples are firm and slightly more tart than other varieties, making them the ideal pie apple. When the slices are hand-mixed with sugar and cinnamon and then baked, the apples transform into sweet, perfectly cooked filling for the best Apple Crumble Pie this side of Grandma's kitchen. This tasty filling is nestled in a flaky pastry pie crust and topped with a crumble that's made with butter, brown sugar, oats, and cinnamon. This Pie is ready to slice and serve, or you can warm it up in a conventional oven at 350° for 20 minutes. Whip up a little whipped Whipping Cream [sku 98185] and spoon a dollop on top of a slice. Or, if you're an à la mode type of pie-eater, TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576] can help you out.

We also happen to be quite fond of breakfast foods. So when our product developer brought Trader Joe's Pancake Bread-an ode to bread and breakfast-to our tasting panel, it was love at first bite. What exactly is Pancake Bread, you ask? To put it succinctly, it's a twist on a buttermilk short stack, baked into a sweet, moist loaf. But where's the fun in being succinct when you're talking about carbs?! The loaf itself is unbelievably moist, with a golden-brown hue and a tender, cake-like crumb. We even use a bit of real maple syrup in the dough itself, so when you warm the Bread in your oven or toaster, you can invoke the Bread's namesake breakfast food without needing to bust out the griddle. But wait-there's more! (We've always wanted to say that.) Each loaf of Pancake Bread is crowned with a layer of sweet, crumbly streusel, made with real butter, brown sugar and fragrant cinnamon-picture the glorious crumble that accompanies a coffee cake, and you'll be on the right track. You may think we're gilding the loaf here (and that may be true), but this maple-cinnamon breakfast flavor combo was just too good to pass up. Try a hearty slice of Pancake Bread with a glass of milk or hot cup of coffee, and you'll be hard-pressed to say otherwise. Each loaf comes packaged in a sturdy, kraft paper tray with a re-closable lid, which helps it to maintain its moist texture, and we've left it unsliced, which allows you to slice it as thick or thin as your heart desires. In addition to being fond of bread and breakfast, we're also quite fond of great values-which is why we're offering 15-ounce loaves of Trader Joe's Pancake Bread for the WOW price of $3.99 each. Similar breads sell in bakeshops for $5.99-or more! You'll find them stacked on our bakery tables.",

These Macaroons come from a specialty bakery in New York that has been producing small batch, hand-crafted baked goods for over 70 years. Unlike other versions, ours incorporate no fillers (such as flour). Instead, the first ingredient is dried coconut, providing loads of pure coconutty flavor. They're baked at a low temperature for a long period of time, guaranteeing a finished Macaroon that is crisp and chewy on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside. Our Coconut Macaroons make a wonderful treat any time. Enjoy them instead of a cookie.

To this day, Banana Bread consistently ranks in the top ten searched-for recipes online every year, and even our very own Banana Bread Mix [sku 85218] and Banana Bonanza Bread [sku 00163] have remained beloved fixtures on our shelves for close to a decade. With such a storied history, what could be next for this crown jewel of comfort? Look no further than Trader Joe's Vegan Banana Bread with Walnuts, a perfectly sweet and soft-textured Banana Bread, achieved without the use of dairy or eggs (or, of course, any other animal products). Whenever we introduce a vegan version of an existing product, we always make sure that it will appeal to non- vegans as well-our philosophy being that when it comes to comfort food, you shouldn't have to compromise. We're happy to report that Trader Joe's Vegan Banana Bread passes this test with flying colors, boasting a fabulously sweet banana-walnut flavor and dense, moist texture. Every soft, flavorful bite gives in nicely, without any of the rough or gritty consistency that you can occasionally encounter in certain other \"alternative\" breads. Whether you enjoy it alone, as it is, by the slice, or you enhance your experience with a bit of Crunchy Almond Butter [sku 91989] (which we especially recommend if you pop it in your toaster oven for a bit, first), Trader Joe's Vegan Banana Bread with Walnuts is our uncompromisingly delicious, comprehensively comforting, and veritably vegan take on a classic baked treat.

Never one to disappoint, our product developer rolled up her sleeves and worked with a trusted bakery partner in Canada to create the newest addition to our fall bakery lineup, Trader Joe's Apple Caramel Slab Pie. The construction of this sweet creation breaks tradition from that of its pie predecessors; rather than being baked in a round tin, its crust is formed into a rectangular slab (hence the name). Not only does this shape ensure even cooking (and reheating), it also makes parceling out pieces for dinner guests a cinch. The filling inside said crust is all the more impressive: a luscious, scratch-made caramel sauce of butter, sugar and whipping cream envelops cinnamon-spiced Northern Spy apples (from the bakery's own orchard!). The whole thing is topped with another layer of flaky pastry crust and dusted with coarse sugar, then baked to a glowing golden brown. Yummmmm. Keep a few Apple Caramel Slab Pies on hand for all of your fall entertaining needs-or just to have a sweet treat after the busy weeknight bustle of soccer practice and homework. Enjoy it warm from the oven-plain is just perfect; whipped cream, ice cream or chocolate sauce would be the proverbial cherry on top of this already distinct dessert.

But the point stands: there's just something about waking up to a satisfying muffin on your plate that makes a morning feel special, and makes you feel ready to take on the day. That's precisely the feeling we intend to invoke with Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins, a four-pack of light, cakey muffins, each filled with a bountful bunch of blueberries and topped with a sprinkling of crunchy sugar. Blueberry muffins are a true classic of the muffin category, and Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins play to every one of the genre's strengths: a crumbly, cakey texture, delightful hints of lemon zest, and, of course, an abundance of wild and cultivated blueberries in each bite. While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on- the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission. After that, we recommend a generous application of butter, a drizzling of honey, or a sizeable spreading of Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd [sku 07850].

One of the more amusing origin stories we've come across traces it back to an American sea Captain Hanson Gregory. The story goes that, on a particularly choppy voyage, Capt.

They're wonderful warmed up or straight out of the package. These Brownies are also decadently delicious with a scoop of Ultra Chocolate Ice Cream [sku 78572]. And if you're looking to really impress your palate, try blending them into a milkshake for a truly outstanding warm weather treat. You'll find these on our Bakery tables, nearby their Brookie brethren. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Sea Salt Brownie Bites",

   "description": "The Madeleine is a truly exceptional cookie-so exceptional, in fact, that the broader baking world considers it to be, technically, a small cake. If you've ever tried a Madeleine, that might not come as a surprise, as their mildly sweet flavor and soft, airy crumb are certainly as luxurious as any cake you'll find. That's especially true of Trader Joe's Gluten Free Madeleine Cookies, made for us by a bakery partner in France who uses just the right ratio of gluten free flours and starches to give each of these Madeleines the same superb flavor and captivatingly cake-like texture as you'd expect from their conventional counterparts at a Parisian patisserie. Talk about having your cake and eating it, too! While our Gluten Free Madeleine Cookies can be enjoyed entirely on their own, as a solitary sweet treat or quick, post-meal dessert, we're particularly partial to serving them with a cup of coffee or tea. (Try them dunked in our French Roast [sku 57359] for an especially appropriate accompaniment.) And for an even more elevated eating experience (and a romantic dessert-for-two option), try dipping them in melted dark chocolate and sprinkling them with chopped Pistachios [sku 98684] or crushed Freeze Dried Strawberries [sku 80665].

   "description": "When the weather heats up and turning on the oven loses its luster, you can still quell a craving for carbs with a visit to the bakery section at your neighborhood Trader Joe's. You'll find everyday staples like sliced breads, bagels, and tortillas, along with a seasonally rotating selection of muffins, cookies, and pastries-all for a fraction of the prices you might find elsewhere. Case in point: Trader Joe's Danish Princess Pastry. Not to be confused with the Swedish sponge cake bearing the same name (who knew so many sweets were marked with this royal moniker?), Trader Joe's Danish Princess Pastry is made for us in Denmark, constructed of classic, tender pastry dough cradling a creamy, custard style, persipan-infused filling. (Fun fact: persipan is an aromatic confectionary ingredient used in baking, and as you might guess, akin to marzipan, but made with apricot kernels instead of almonds.) Rather than a single-serve round, this Danish is formed into an easy-to- slice rectangle that can easily feed a crowd, and with a just-about-even ratio of pastry to filling, it's equally at home on a breakfast buffet or dessert platter. It can be enjoyed right out of the package, and if you can stand the heat, a 2-to-4-minute stint in the oven truly takes it over the top. Whether you enjoy your Pastry warm or cold, do as the Danes do and complement it with a strong, dark cup of coffee, like TJ's French Roast [sku 77083]. Danish Princess Pastry",

It's an especially prominent player in traditional Scandinavian pastries (which are currently experiencing a moment in the spotlight), and happens to play a starring role in our very own Trader Joe's Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns. These limited-edition Sweet Rolled Danish Pastries are made in Denmark, where our supplier hand-forms the eggy dough into elegant knots, and incorporates plenty of Cardamom and Brown Sugar in the process. Once baked, the resulting pastry isn't overly sweet, allowing the heady spice notes to take center stage in each tender bite. Cozy up with a Bun and a cup of rich, dark roast coffee as an antidote to chilly winter weather- they can be enjoyed right out of the package, or heated for a few minutes in the oven. Perhaps best of all, you can find packages of two, generously-sized Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns on the bakery shelves at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, for less than the price of one similar pastry elsewhere-if one can even be found!

The newest member of the lineup is sweet, fruity, and beautifully blue-that's right, Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins are in the Bakery section for a limited time! Let's start from the (muffin) top. These wheatless wonders mimic gluten's texture building properties thanks to a blend of cornstarch, tapioca starch, oat flour, and not one, but three types of rice flour. We combine this magical mixture with sour cream, a hint of natural vanilla flavor, and a smidge of lemon oil for a moist, tangy, and aromatic cake base that rivals its glutenous counterparts. There are no blueberry muffins without blueberries, and our Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins are chock full of 'em. Baking brings the berries to their sweetest, fruitiest, and bluest form for muffins that taste as vibrant as they look. Coarse sugar and oat streusel top off each muffin top with a bit of crunch and a boost of butter.

The dough is paired with a tart Raspberry filling that's been sweetened with a bit of sugar and complemented with a touch of lemon juice to further amplify the fruit. But rather than rolling them into the classic Croissant shape, the layers of dough are sandwiched around the jammy filling, like a coffee cake-a sedimentary construction that allows for the inclusion of much more filling than you'd find in an individual croissant. Merveilleux! Sprinkled with coarse sugar crystals and baked until the dough reaches a lovely, deep golden hue, this impressive Carré (that's French for \"square,\" a nod to this pastry's squarish shape) serves six. Pick one up from the bakery shelf at your neighborhood Trader Joe's and enjoy right out of the package-it's a fantastic slice-and-serve option for a breakfast meeting or weekend brunch, paired with a steaming cup of coffee. To attain maximum deliciousness, remove the outer packaging and warm the Carré in a 350°F oven-you'll be rewarded with a fresh, French-style pastry, without the upscale bakery price tag you might find elsewhere.

So, when the time came to bring in our own version to our Bakery shelves, we knew we had to get every aspect of it right. That meant only the most satisfyingly crispy exterior, only the most pleasantly chewy interior, and only the most bright and flavorful cinnamon- sugar coating would do-or, perhaps we should say, would snickerdoo.

Each box of Trader Joe's Snickerdoodle Cookies contains a dozen perfectly baked, scrumptiously cinammon-y Snickerdoodles, ready to be enjoyed whenever the Snickerdoodle mood strikes. (Please pardon the repetition; it really is just that fun to say.) Made from a traditional, homestyle recipe that includes cream of tartar for an extra crisp texture and korintje cinnamon for an even brighter touch of cinnamon spice in every bite, they make a great school or work lunch dessert, as well as a simple, anytime sweet treat.

Breakfast eaters most often enjoy Brussels-style waffles, which are fairly large and rectangular with light, airy insides, and an exterior crunch-similar to Trader Joe's Belgian Waffles [sku 96967]. But another Belgian waffle has been gaining global fans in recent years, and it hails from the city of Liège. Trader Joe's Brioche Style Liège Waffles follow in this tradition. Made for us in Belgium, our Liège Waffle dough not only includes flour, yeast, water, and salt-but also incorporates cultured butter, pearl sugar, and egg. This recipe yields a denser Waffle with buttery, brioche-like flavor. Compared to Brussels-style waffles, these are smaller and roundish, with rustic, uneven edges. And there's a distinct crunch that comes from the bits of sugar strewn throughout these handheld batter-cakes. Waffle lovers will be enamored by the fact that Trader Joe's Brioche Liège Waffles can be enjoyed at room temperature, no toasting required. Enjoy them for an afternoon snack, as many Europeans do. Or grab one on your way out the door in the morning for a quick, satisfying breakfast. Of course, you can still opt to top them with whatever you like.

That time of year when nature reawakens, spreading boundless blossoms across the landscape-it's downright inspiring.

Trader Joe's Lemon Flower Cookies are made for us by a trusted bakery partner, who starts with a base of beautifully buttery shortbread dough that's been flavored with lemon oil and colored a pastel yellow with turmeric. After shaping the dough into a fancifully floral shape and baking it to a flawlessly crumbly texture, they then fill the center with a lemon jam, so that every bite sings with a satisfyingly citric sweetness. We invite you to join us in giving a toast to springtime by enjoying a Trader Joe's Lemon Flower Cookie with a cup of your favorite tea-ideally, something similarly citric, like our always-excellent Organic Earl Grey [sku 62680]. They make a handsome addition to a spring-themed dessert board, especially when you have folks over for brunch.

And when foregoing a from- scratch recipe, don't ever think you must compromise the from-scratch flavor and quality. With Trader Joe's Brownie Truffle Baking Mix, you're given the best of both worlds! Excellent taste and texture from excellent ingredients without having to source them and learn to whip 'em up yourself. After approximately 45 minutes, including prep time, and adding only 2 large eggs and a melted stick of butter - both also available everyday at your neighborhood Trader Joe's - you will have a freshly baked pan of decadent brownies bound to impress your friends and family at a get-together or have at-the-ready for a post-dinner delight. And at-the-ready you'll be from the second you begin to smell the illustrious aroma coming from the oven. Our Brownie Truffle Baking Mix includes dutch cocoa. And no, this doesn't mean it wears cute little wooden shoes, but instead means that it was processed with alkali and doesn't contain the acidity or strong, concentrated cocoa flavor. This makes for a chocolatey brownie, that while still very chocolatey, it's a different kind of chocolatey. For good measure, we also throw in chocolate chips which, when melted from the baking, create little islands of melty-chocolatey goodness with every bite. But don't let us dictate what you can add!

   "description": "We are known for our WOW Customer Experience, but do we really consider customers' requests for new products? Of course we do! Case-in-point: Trader Joe's Marshmallows. For some time now, we've listened to the cries of mallow-fiends, fluff enthusiasts, and campers everywhere. Give us marshmallows, or give us death! they cry. Okay, we're exaggerating-but extreme language aside, the sentiment is real: our customers want marshmallows. The thing is, not just any marshmallow is worthy of the Trader Joe's name. So we took our time. We searched high and low. And we believe we've found marshmallow mecca. Not only are Trader Joe's Marshmallows free from artificial flavors, added colors, and GMO ingredients (which cannot be said for most other brands), but they are also gluten free and... drumroll, please¿ gelatin free! If you follow a vegan or kosher diet, you know this is special-it's nearly impossible to find marshmallows made without gelatin, and if you do, they typically cost an arm and a marshmallow-man-sized leg. Roast our Marshmallows over the fire at your family cookout. Use them in your next batch of rice crispy treats made with TJ's Crisp Rice Cereal [sku 94665]. Melt them over a sweet potato bake or a bag of TJ's Sweet Potato Fries [sku 92157]-you know, like cheese fries... but¿ mallow fries. And if you happen to get caught in the wilderness without your gear, we dare say that a bag of our fluffy-yet-substantial Marshmallows would make a decent pillow. (Because you might forget your pillow, but nobody forgets the marshmallows¿) We're selling each ten ounce bag of Trader Joe's Marshmallows for $2.99-but stock up while you can, because these pillow-y puffs are seasonal and will be gone by summer's end¿ 05.09. 16",

   "description": "Fitness fanatics have been mixing protein powder with their pancake batter for ages, but it wasn't until a few years ago, when these fit folks began uploading recipes and cooking demo videos online, that regular Joes took note. Pretty soon, everyone was making Protein Pancakes for breakfast-including our Buyer. At first, she made hers from scratch, but when she discovered a now-popular pre-made mix, she renounced her own recipe altogether. The mix made delicious pancakes, but still, something was missing. Or, rather, she wished that something had been missing-the added sugars, to be specific. So, in true TJ's fashion, she contacted that much-loved mix-maker and struck a deal to develop a Mix of our very own. Made with simple, hearty ingredients like whole wheat flour, whole grain oat flour, whey protein concentrate, and buttermilk powder, Trader Joe's Buttermilk Protein Pancake Mix isn't just good for a purposefully protein-y product; it's good, period. It's also a cinch to prepare-no muscle required. Just combine equal parts Mix and water, and you're on your way to fluffy, satisfying Pancakes that are packed with Protein (ten grams per two-pancake serving) but free from that dreaded chalky, protein powder-y aftertaste. Or, if pancakes aren't your thing, feel free to bust out the waffle iron instead-just be sure to add one Tablespoon of TJ's Grapeseed [sku 31826]or TJ's Canola [sku 52029] Oil per cup of dry mix. Prepare our Protein Pancake Mix per package instructions, then top the finished flapjacks with anything your little heart & bulging biceps desire. Decorate them with a drizzle of almond butter and a fan of sliced bananas. Top them with a mountain of whipped cream and fresh berries. Or, go the traditional route and drown them in butter and syrup. The Mix contains zero grams of added sugars per serving (and less than one gram of total sugars), so don't be miserly with the maple-take that shortstack on down to syrup town! We're selling one-pound boxes of Trader Joe's Buttermilk Protein Pancake Mix for $3.49 each. We've done the math, and that comes out to about 15¢ per pancake-that's one hot deal for one hotcake.

   "description": "Ever wonder what the \"Bourbon\" in Bourbon Vanilla Extract refers to? The alcohol content connection might make you think it has something to do with bourbon whiskey, but the truth is that the two are only indirectly related: both Bourbon County, the birthplace of bourbon whiskey, and Île Bourbon, an old name of an island where vanilla is famously harvested, are named for the House of Bourbon, the former ruling family of France. In fact, only vanilla harvested from islands in the Indian Ocean, like Île Bourbon (now known as Réunion) can be called Bourbon Vanilla. And that's precisely what you'll find in each bottle of Trader Joe's Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract. Bold, full-flavored, and grown using organic certified practices, this Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract is ideal for use in making your favorite baked goods, stirring into frostings or icings, or even dropping a bit into smoothies, pancake mixes, or oatmeal. Because it's made with pure Bourbon Vanilla, its intense vanilla aromatics and flavor are accompanied by a few finer, more delicate notes, like cream and even a bit of spice, making it a must- have for veteran and neophyte home bakers alike. And since it's available at Trader Joe's, it's a pretty intense value, too: You can find four-ounce bottles of Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract in our Grocery aisles for $9.99*, every day. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

At Trader Joe's, we have Almond Flour [sku 56254] and Gluten Free Flour [sku 50007], and of course, good ol' wheat flour, including this Organic Unbleached All-Purpose Flour. Trader Joe's Organic Unbleached All-Purpose Flour is exactly that, nothing more. And while simple, as with all Trader Joe's products, this one has a story to tell. It begins as organically grown wheat from U.S. farms. That wheat is milled to a fine consistency that's great for all your culinary needs (thus, All -Purpose). Unlike much mass-market flour, though, this one isn't bleached and highly processed - ever notice \"enriched' on the packaging for flour? It's only \"enriched\" with vitamins and minerals because heavily processing and bleaching the flour to make it oh-so-white strips all the naturally occurring vitamins and minerals out. Ours is just milled, packed into paper sacks, and sent to Trader Joe's. A simple story, but a riveting one nonetheless.

   "description": "Trader Joe's Organic Alcohol Free Pure Vanilla Flavor is the no-alcohol way to get the flavor and fragrance of real vanilla into your recipes. Traditional vanilla extract is made by steeping vanilla beans in some kind of alcohol solution; this Alcohol Free alternative is made by steeping vanilla beans from Madagascar with plant- based glycerin. As with any good vanilla, the real secret here is in the beans. The Planifolia orchid from which these vanilla beans hail is a delicate plant - its flowers come out for only about 24-36 hours, at which time they are hand pollinated. From that moment, it takes about nine months for the beans to mature on the vine. Once picked, the beans are cured for three more months, allowing their flavor to intensify. Only after this curing is complete are the beans steeped with the glycerin to create an amber-colored, full-flavored Organic Alcohol Free Pure Vanilla Flavor. Use it wherever you'd use traditional extract; expect excellent results! We're selling it in a four ounce bottle, every day.

Making them from scratch, however, is not always an option-so what's a muffin maven to do? Keep a box of Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffin Mix on hand, that's what! This masterful Mix brings you that much closer to a fresh batch of Blueberry Muffins, offering consistent, from-scratch flavor without all the measuring the from-scratch process usually entails. After countless trials of careful taste-testing (a tough job, we know), the tasting panel determined that freeze-dried Blueberries, when rehydrated and stirred into the batter, were far superior in flavor and texture than regular dried blueberries in the finished Muffins, and almost indistinguishable from their fresh counterparts-so we've included them in the box! You supply the refrigerated staples (butter, eggs, and milk or non-dairy beverage of choice), apply a bit of elbow grease, and you'll end up with 12, generously-sized, enjoyably sweet Blueberry Muffins, with a tender crumb that's studded with plenty of blueberries throughout.

Historically reputed to have medicinal properties, they were once prescribed as cure-alls for headaches, stomachaches, indigestion, and cramps. Fast-forward to modern day usage, however, and you can think of bitters as a bartender's \"salt-and-pepper,\" a liquid seasoning of sorts that adds depth and nuance that really tie a drink together. Trader Joe's Classic Bitters are aromatic and complex, with strong notes of clove, cinnamon, and herbs. They're made exclusively for us in downtown Los Angeles at the first licensed distillery since Prohibition. A bottle of Classic Bitters is befitting of any bar setup and is made without the use of artificial flavors or coloring, which can't be said for similar products out in the market. The aforementioned process of infusing botanicals into alcohol to create these Bitters can take anywhere from days to weeks, requiring careful testing along the way to ensure the desired flavor and quality of the end product. With Trader Joe's Classic Bitters, the work has been done for you, so all you have to do is open the bottle and add them to your drink of choice-Old Fashioned, anyone? And if cocktails aren't your calling, fret not-there are plenty of other uses for bitters. You can add a few splashes to iced tea, shake them over ice cream, or dash atop a fruit bowl for added complexity and spice. Classic Bitters",

What you might not have encountered, however, is vanilla paste. What's the difference, you ask? Aside from their distinct methods of production (vanilla extract is made by soaking pure vanilla beans in a solution of water and alcohol, whereas vanilla paste is a mix of vanilla beans, sugar syrup, and some vanilla extract to tie them all together), vanilla paste is thicker, richer in taste, and tends to have more visible bits of vanilla bean throughout, making it a preferable option for recipes where you really want the vanilla to be front and center. And that's exactly where Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste excels. Made for us by a supplier in Mauritius with 100% Bourbon (as in, grown in one of the designated Bourbon islands within the Indian Ocean) Vanilla Beans, this Vanilla Paste adds a well-rounded sweetness and deep, full-bodied flavor of vanilla to cakes, cookies, pies, and more. It can be used in a straight 1:1 ratio as a substitute for vanilla extract, for any recipe you'd like to make that much more vanilla-y, and makes an excellent ingredient for cocktails, milkshakes, and homemade coffee drinks.

   "description": "The coconut palm (cocos nucifera) is known in Malaysia as \"the tree of a thousand uses\" and in the Philippines as \"the tree of life.\" To say it is a prolific plant would be an understatement. One of its sweetest by-products is, in fact, sugar. It begins by tapping the nectar from the palm tree flower. The sap is then heated in large drums to evaporate the moisture, condensing the sweet juice into what are basically sugar crystals. Very similar to brown sugar, it is sweet with slight caramel overtones. Long a traditional sweetener used throughout much of Asia, Coconut Sugar is becoming quite popular in the United States. It is made from the coconut palm, and all things coconut continue to be hot. Moreover, it is considered to be a more desirable alternative to refined or chemically synthesized sweetener alternatives, in part, because it is purported to retain some nutrients and to be lower on the Glycemic Index. These claims may have some appeal, but the fact is - it's sugar with a nice caramelized flavor. It is delightful for baking, makes a perfect topping for oatmeal or fresh-cut fruit, and adds tickle-your-tounge dimension to an array of dishes, beverages or sauces.

Both of these questions aren't easily answered by just cruising through the drive-thru. As is so often the case, Trader Joe's offers a better solution for the quick-burger-fix: 80% Lean/20% Fat - Ground Beef Patties. Though it doesn't take a star-studded Michelin chef to form ground beef into patties, it's definitely a time-saver to open up a fresh package of our all-Beef Patties and slap them directly on your grill or fry-pan. As for what goes in them, it's simple: 100% Ground Beef that is 80% Lean and 20% Fat. We've discovered this is just the right ratio to produce a juicy, flavorful burger. Each package is approximately one pound and contains four pre-formed Beef Patties (about four ounces each). Warm up a cast-iron frying pan over medium heat with a pad of butter in the center. When the butter melts, briefly toast four TJ's Honey Wheat Hamburger Buns [sku 30321] and set aside. Add more butter, and sprinkle your Patties with salt and pepper before placing in the hot pan-if there's no sizzle, turn up the heat! About three minutes per side should get you to about medium-rare.

Mignon means \"cute\" in French, implying the dainty and tender nature of this cut. Coming from a non-weight bearing muscle on the animal, the filet has significantly less connective tissue, making it the most tender and arguably most desirable Steak. It's also very lean-with minimal fat marbling-presenting a moderate flavor given to preparations including wrapping in bacon or plating with a rich sauce.

Trader Joe's Choice Premium Angus Beef Rib Eye Steak is one of four cuts we offer on the Choice Grade tier-the grade just below USDA Prime (usually found only in fine restaurants). A Rib Eye is a rib steak with the bone removed. Coming from the rib cage area, it's a muscle that's only lightly worked, making it one of the more tender steaks available. And as the \"eye\" (center of the rib steak), it's also the most flavorful part. Our Choice Angus Beef Rib Eye is rich with fat marbling that not only allows it to maintain its tenderness during almost any kind of cooking, it also helps provide beefy, melt-in-your-mouth flavor.

   "description": "For some time now, we've been working on revamping our fresh meats section. We started by offering Beef Filet Mignon Steaks [sku 56226] and USDA Choice Premium Angus Beef Filet Mignon Steaks [sku 56216] in stores at the beginning of the year. Now, we've got something even more exceptionally rare: Trader Joe's USDA Choice Angus Center Cut Filet Mignon Steaks. Two small words make all the difference here: Center Cut. While we already offer a Choice Grade filet mignon, this Steak takes it up one more notch. Coming from the tenderloin of Angus cattle, these Center Cut Filet Mi- gnons are thick and more uniform in size, allowing for consistent cooking of the tender, buttery beef. Our sup- plier hand-trims these filets for consistency in size, quality, and color. And yet another rare attribute? The USDA Choice Grade: it's just one notch below USDA Prime Grade, which is usually only available in fine restaurants. How's that for a quality cut? Because the tenderloin cut comes from a muscle that does very little work, the meat produced has less connec- tive tissue and is therefore the most tender, lean cut of beef. Prepare our Center Cut Filets by wrapping in bacon or plating with a rich sauce to add a punch of flavor to an otherwise moderately flavored-yet tender-filet. For the incredibly rare price of $22.99 per pound, there's not much at stake here, aside from a satiating dinner.

   "description": "Picture the scene: it's time for a big holiday meal. The table is set, family and friends fill the seats around it, and the food is ready. But what is that food that everyone's so excited to dig into? We're guessing the star of the meal is Trader Joe's Choice Premium Angus Beef Boneless Rib Roast, because if anything is worthy of being the holiday meal centerpiece, it is this. So, what makes our Rib Roast so incredibly special? Where to begin¿ Rib roasts come from the primal rib section-the same section ribeye steaks are cut from. We've sourced roasts only from Angus cattle raised in the U.S. and fed all-vegetarian diets. What's more? These roasts also fall into the upper two-thirds of the Choice grading scale, meaning it's got more marbling and just a notch below USDA Prime. Only about one in fifty steaks meet this strict specification. There's a fat cap on each roast, giving it su- preme melt-in-your-mouth flavor. The entire boneless roast is wrapped in netting to keep it from expanding during the roasting process, leaving you with a tasty, roast-shaped roast. For such a delicious dinner centerpiece, our Rib Roast is quite easy to prepare. For the ideal roast, you'll want to have a meat thermometer and a roasting rack. Simply rub the roast with olive oil, salt, and pepper and follow the roasting directions on the package for the perfect holiday delicacy. One more thing that makes Trader Joe's Choice Premium Angus Beef Boneless Rib Roast exceptional: the value. We're selling this only-for-the-holidays Roast for $11.99 per pound-the same price as the bone-in roast we sold last year. A more-than-worthy holiday meal superstar. 12.04. 17",

   "description": "If there's any truth to the old adage that you are what you eat, then it stands to reason that you should probably pay attention to what your food eats, too. That's the philosophy behind grass-fed beef, the increasingly popular category of meat from cows raised on diets of grass, alfalfa, and other foraged plants, which the cows naturally graze on in open pastures. The resulting beef, like our Trader Joe's Grass Fed Organic Top Sirloin Beef Steak, tends to be leaner, more savory, and, as grass fed beef fans tend to describe it, just plain \"meatier\" in taste. Of course, the ranchers who produce our Grass Fed Organic Top Sirloin take things one step further-in ad- dition to raising their cattle on an exclusively foraged diet, they also adhere to strict USDA organic guidelines, meaning the cattle are never given hormones or antibiotics, and the pastures they feed from are grown entirely without GMOs or chemical pesticides. That's right: These cows don't just eat grass, they eat organic grass. How's that for watching for your diet? So the question arises: how best to prepare such a carefully cultivated cut of meat? We recommend keeping it simple-some light seasoning, a quick sear in the pan over low heat and about 10 minutes in an oven pre-heated to 350°F will do nicely. Or, if you're feeling more adventurous, let your sirloin marinate in a mix of Soy Sauce [sku 26426], Toasted Sesame Oil [sku 24827], Organic Brown Sugar [76513], and Simpler Times Lager [92188] overnight, then cook over a hot grill for five to six minutes per side, or until a meat thermometer reads 145°F. If you are what you eat, does eating a perfectly seared Grass Fed Organic Top Sirloin Beef Steak make you grass-fed, too? That's for the philosophers to decide. In the meantime, we're selling each 6 oz. steak for $7.49, every day. You'll find them in our refrigerated meat case. 07.09. 18",

   "description": "Among the benefits of traveling the world in search of deliciousness is realizing that some of the best tasting foods have some of the most interesting names. To wit: gyoza, baklava and gazpacho. Another of our perennial favorites? Bool Kogi. Traditionally served in Korean barbeque restaurants (and often translated as one word, bulgogi), Bool Kogi is what Koreans call sweet, sesame-soy-garlic marinated boneless beef ribs. The literal translation of Bool Kogi is \"fire meat.\" This is likely a reference to the flame used in cooking the meat. It could also refer to the spicy sauces that often accompany it. There's even a chance it's an allusion to an actual fire, but we've looked into this, and it doesn't appear to be the case. In any event, to enjoy it at home, just fire up your grill or broiler and cook the meat very quickly over high heat. Serve inside fresh lettuce leaves, with (or without) a spicy sauce like TJ's Sriracha Sauce [sku 50828], for a quick, flavorful, lettuce taco-style meal that will certainly have you and your guests fired up. Bool Kogi is flavorful enough that you can serve it with no sauce at all. Slice it up for salads or sandwiches, or make it the center of attention at dinner any night of the week. Bool Kogi from Trader Joe's comes in random-weight, vacuum-sealed packages for $9.99 per pound, a price that has us all fired up and ready to grill!",

Trader Joe's has always been an enthusiastic supporter of home-grillers, with our top-quality ground beef options, such as 85/15 Organic Grass Fed Ground Beef [sku 92558], and 80/20 Ground Beef Patties [sku 55923]. For those looking for a ready- for-the-grill burger with a uniquely flavorful twist, you'll want to try Trader Joe's Angus C.B.P. Ground Beef 1/3 lb. Patties. This is a Ground blend of three different whole-muscle cuts of Angus beef. Angus refers to the more muscular Aberdeen Angus cattle breed, which yields meat with plenty of fat marbling. This marbling translates into juicy, tender meat. More specifically, this C.B.P. blend incorporates Angus cuts from the shoulder (Chuck), chest (Brisket), and rump (Picanha). The Brisket (20% of the blend) and Picanha (5%) each contribute amazingly rich flavor, with their slightly fattier composition, while the leaner and more conventional ground Chuck (75%) brings additional 'beefiness' and balance. All of this amounts to a Ground Beef blend that is about 75% lean/25% fat-ideal for quick, hot grilling. And the substantial size of these pre-portioned 1/3 lb. Patties allows them to remain tender & juicy, even when cooked over the flames. The resulting bigger burgers will also easily fill TJ's Brioche Buns [sku 61752] to satisfy even the hungriest BBQ-goers-but only for a limited time. Find 21.3-ounce (1 lb. 5.3 oz.) packages of four Trader Joe's Angus C.B.P. Ground Beef Patties in our refrigerators, while the summer grilling season lasts. Angus C.B.P. Ground Beef 1/3 lb Patties",

The authentically flavored marinade is made just for us-we worked with one of our longtime suppliers to create this very traditional, northern-Mexico-inspired blend of citrus & spice-it elevates mere meat to something really special. Carne Asada is a natural for tacos, burritos, or fajitas and can also hold its own center-of-the-plate, along with all the traditional accompaniments of Mexican cuisine (we're thinking sour cream, guacamole, cilantro...).

The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures-their diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that's rich in healthful Omega-3 fatty acids. Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional methods. If you've ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is why-it requires more space, more time, and more labor. At Trader Joe's, we work diligently to ensure that though the price may be higher, it represents excellent value. With that in mind, our Organic Grass Fed Ground Beef is $6.99 for a one pound package, which is a terrific value for organic, grass fed ground beef, a price that's 50¢-a-pound less than our price last year. 85/15 refers to the ratio of lean to fat, meaning that this Organic Ground Beef is 85% lean.

Soft to the bite, beautifully cocoa-brown to the eye, and delicious to the taste buds, Trader Joe's Soft Bite Mini Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti cookies are a delight for all senses. The modern Italian word biscotto (singular of biscotti) comes from the medieval Latin word biscoctus, meaning \"twice-cooked\". A process that was used to serve the purpose of drying and preserving foods to be stored and remain fresh for long periods of time. Which is a perfectly subtle distillation of the baking process our Biscottis undergo. Each Trader Joe's Soft Bite Mini Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti is mixed by hand in small batches using real butter, eggs, and hazelnuts throughout the process. Following this, the dough is then twice baked as per traditional biscotti baking methods. It is first baked in a loaf and then cut to bake these cut \"slices\" a second time for that final biscotti texture. However unlike a traditional biscotti, our Soft Bite Mini Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti cookies are made to have a more delicate texture - almost a cross between a crispy biscotto cookie and a sugar cookie. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.",

On these farms, grass-fed cows produce remarkably rich, deliciously creamy milk. On one such farm in particular, the master cheesemakers use this milk to craft a soft, easy-eating Cheddar, then age it for six to twelve months to give it a nice sharp note and full-flavored profile. And after all that, they ship it off to us, where it becomes Trader Joe's New Zealand Grass Fed Sharp Cheddar. With its mild, creamy base, punctuated nutty notes, and hint of cultured butter, this New Zealand Cheddar is quite versatile for a white Cheddar. It slices nicely for inclusion in sandwiches and burgers, it melts wonderfully for queso dips or cheesy potato soups, and postively wows when shredded and served over a fresh plate of Handsome Cut Fries [sku 96143]. And if that weren't enough, it fares just as well on a cheese plate, especially when paired with some fruit-forward or spicy red wine and a bit of dried fruit. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

That alternative is Belletoile Triple Cream and dipping a spoon into this will not only be culturally acceptable, but maybe even have a hint of class. Belletoile Triple Cream is produced in the Lorraine region of France and has similar qualities to the bries we all know and love. But what sets Belletoile Triple Cream apart from other soft-ripened cheeses like traditional brie and camembert is the addition of extra cream before the production process. This gives Belletoile its superiorly creamy and mellow mouthfeel. Of course, this additional cream and milk also comes from cows that have never been given rBST hormones. The milk is pasteurized, and to it is added the butterfat-rich cream. The fresh curds are then aged briefly; soft-ripened to develop a bloomy-white, edible rind. You get a cheese that is creamy and decadent with a rich, buttery quality-perfect as an appetizer or dessert. Serve it with fresh or dried fruit, nuts, crusty bread, or crisp crackers. The crisp acidity of a sparkling wine is the perfect complement to every slice of Belletoile Triple Cream. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Belletoile Triple Cream Cheese",

We've been carrying Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese for decades because we believe the semi-soft texture and fresh, buttery flavors are a great representation of the hall(den)mark Danish cheese. The story of Danish Havarti is one of a noble 1800s exploit where a farmer based just north of Copenhagen traveled around the European continent in search for knowledge about cheesemaking. When she returned from her travels in 1852, she developed the technique to make the uniquely Danish Harvati Cheese. While this technique yielded a semi-firm cheese dotted with small holes, it is a bit different than what's modernly made as \"flødehavarti\" or \"cream Havarti\". Trader Joe's Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese is made using pasteurized milk that allows whey proteins to stick around that would otherwise be eliminated while processing the curd, giving it a signature creamy texture and taste. Ripened very little, cream Havarti Cheese has a mellow, buttery aroma, much like that of Swiss cheese, and a sweet, creamy, paste with mild saltiness and nutty notes. While we're touting the lovely simplicity of our traditional Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese, it is a variety of cheese often adorned with added flavors such as dill (like our Havarti Cheese with Dill [sku 72490]), garlic, cranberries, jalapeños, you name it!

At least when we have a nibble, we can't imagine many things better on this planet. The eponymous county of Jarlsberg is just south of Oslo, and it was there that the cheese got its start after its citizens were introduced to Emmental (Swiss) cheeses and cheesemakers tried to replicate the hole-laden delight. Beneath the yellow-orange waxed rind of a wheel of Jarlsberg, filled with holes, is a semi-soft pale interior that is buttery and firm in texture with a mild, nutty flavor. Jarlsberg follows a very similar recipe to that used in days of old which itself is similar to the process for Swiss and Gouda cheeses. A versatile cheese used for both cooking and snacking, its popularity extends far beyond its Scandinavian birthplace. Jarlsberg is the most popular imported cheese in the United States and since 1979, imports have been limited to 15 millions pounds of the good stuff!

To this day, cheesemakers and farmers gather in this city every Thursday morning between 10:00am and 12:30pm from June until August to have their cheese weighed, tested, and priced. Not only is the name recognizable, but the cheese itself accounts for nearly half of the world's cheese consumption! Trader Joe's Dutch Gouda is made from pasteurized cow's milk that is processed in the traditional Gouda style. Cultured milk is curdled, whey is drained, and water added in a process known as washing the curd. This gives the Dutch Gouda its characteristic sweetness as it washes away some of the lactose, resulting in less acid throughout the cheese. Next the cheese moves to its molds which results in the Dutch Gouda's traditional shape and then is dried and given an annatto coating for its yellow hue and to prevent overdrying of the cheese. The red waxed rind of a Gouda indicates a young cheese, like that of Trader Joe's Dutch Gouda.

Then the Fontina is strained through, you guessed it, cheesecloth and placed into wheel-shaped molds to all the paste to set up. After that relatively simple process, we're left with a young Fontina Semi-Soft Cheese ready to be shipped over to our stores and scooped up by our shoppers! And what a tasty, semi-soft cheese it is to scoop up! Like many other cheeses of Italian origins, Fontina has the taste and texture to be enjoyed all on its own, unclouded by additional flavors.

By \"eyes\", we of course mean the plethora of small holes found in many Swiss cheese varieties. What makes them so important to our Baby Swiss, however, is that they are distinctively smaller and more densely packed than with traditional Swiss cheese. Because the Baby Swiss hasn't had as much time to age, the holes don't have as much time to get all that large. It's those poppin' Baby Swiss Cheese peepers, the spongier buttery texture, and the superbly pale yellow, almost ivory-cream color that helps define the physical aspects of Baby Swiss vs. traditional.

While this \"ewe\"phoric ovine cheese is recognized and protected by European law, it doesn't have to be made in Rome; 97% of Pecorino Romano is actually made in Sardinia. Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have Protected Designation of Origin certification, Pecorino Romano is the most ancient as well as the most famous outside of its homeland, Italy. Our supplier uses 100% fresh, unpasteurized sheep's milk for each cut of our Pecorino Romano cheese. Each wheel is dry-salted by hand numerous times, resulting in a fabulously salty flavor. Young Pecorino Romano has a soft, rubbery texture and sweet flavor, but gets progressively sharper and smokier with age. Our Pecorino Romano is aged a minimum of five months to still have that sweet, young cheese essence, but stacked with sharp and salty notes. Because of its hard texture and saltiness, this cheese works wonders as a grating cheese over pasta, breads, and casseroles, or possibly paired with a glass of bold Italian wine or a light beer. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Trader Joe's Dutch Smoked Cheese all begins with a log of Maasdam cheese, a semi hard Dutch cheese that uses pasteurized cow's milk. It was created in the early 1990s as an alternative to pricier Swiss Emmental cheeses, but don't let that fiscally-inspired backstory make you think this cheese tastes \"cheap\". Maasdam is a supple, high fat - minimum of 45% fat - cheese that has a similar flavor and textural profile to its Dutch cousin, Gouda. So all of those luxuriously creamy and buttery flavors are abound, but complimented by the addition of woodsy smoking to both the flavor and aroma, reminiscent of a barbecue. Trader Joe's Dutch Smoked Cheese is an incredible value of a uniquely smoky snacking cheese that can also find its way into many of your favorite cheese-needing recipes! It melts that supple, high fat texture with a light sweet and smoky duality to omelettes, mac and cheese, pizzas, pasta dishes, or whatever culinary adventure you embark on.

Accordingly, they lead their cows that eat lush, green, Irish grass all year round. They'll even move the cows from paddock (small, enclosed field) to paddock ensuring they always have access to the most nourishing grass. This intense cow-care results in incomparable Irish milk-which is made into an extraordinary Irish cheese called Dubliner. The pale yellow paste is sweet and nutty, like mature Cheddar-with the piquant bite of aged Parmesan. You can enjoy its flavor crumbled over salads, sliced on crackers, or melted on a sandwich.

We take our cheeses seriously, and we know our customers do too, so we're willing to trek wherever necessary to find the real deal. We're all familiar with Parmesan cheese, of course, but there's everyday Parmesan cheese, and then there's serious, matured, intensely flavorful Parmesan cheese! Trader Joe's Grana Padano Parmesan fits perfectly in this latter category, being an authentic product of expert cheese makers in northeastern Italy's Po River Valley. They use the same recipe as the 12th-century Cistercian monks that invented Grana Padano-in other words, you can't get more authentic than this. You can taste the centuries of perfection in each bite, too: each wheel of TJ's Grana Padano Parmesan is made with raw milk and aged for at least 18 months, meaning the sweet, savory, and nutty flavors are so profoundly concentrated that they actually manifest in the form of a fine, granular texture throughout the cheese. These granular, crystalized pockets of flavor are, in fact, what the \"Grana\" in Grana Padano refers to. However you serve Trader Joe's Grana Padano Parmesan, be it shaved over some Arugula Ravioli [sku 94346], mixed in with a plate of Antipasto Mediterranean Vegetables [sku 60537], or simply crumbled with a drizzling of balsamic vinegar, you can know with certainty that you're getting the real thing.

A relatively new-to-the-world example of blue cheese, Cambozola Blue Cheese, or \"blue brie\" has a smooth, creamy texture with a considerably mild blue cheese flavor profile. Cambozola is a cross between Camembert and Gorgonzola (and generously named after them with Cambozola being a portmanteau of the two). It marries the creaminess of its Penicillium Camemberti focused mother cheese and the blue speckled veins and sharpness of its Penicillium Roqueforti using father, Gorgonzola. This gives it a blend of savory, nutty flavors with hints of sweetness that enhances this marriage of cheeses found in our Cambozola Blue Cheese. It's a wonderful start to get into the world of blue cheese if you're intimidated by the intense aromas and tangy tastes.

From the six months careful aging to the basket-weave pattern on the cheese's rind to the aromas of flowers, nuts, and lavender, our Manchego is traditional in all ways but one - the price. The price for this very special cheese tends to be very high. But because we sell a great deal of Manchego, we've been able to negotiate a terrific cost from our supplier, which in turn enables us to offer it to you for the excellent value of $9.99 a pound. Don't be fooled by high prices you see elsewhere - their cheese is no better than ours; they just demand a higher price. At our price of $9.99 a pound, you'll pay less than $6 for a random- weight piece of about 9-9.5 ounces - now that's a value!

With more than 40 years of traditional cheese making experience, a famed farm on this estate transforms rich, creamy milk from local grazing herds (within a 30 mile radius) into beautiful, full-bodied farmhouse Cheddar.

That alternative is Trader Joe's Triple Creme Brie Cheese. Triple Creme Brie is produced for us in the region known as Île-de-France (the area surrounding Paris)-from whence all true Bries come and have come since around the 8th century, when King Charlemagne claimed Brie as his preferred fromage. Our supplier works in the heart of Brie country where they produce Brie de Meaux, arguably the world's best Brie. Part of what makes Brie de Meaux so fantastique is the luscious local milk they use, bringing a natural sweetness to the cheese. It is this very same high quality milk collected for Brie de Meaux that is used in our Triple Creme Brie. Of course, this milk also comes from cows that have never been given rBST hormones. The milk is pasteurized, and to it is added butterfat-rich cream. The fresh curds are then aged briefly; soft-ripened to develop a bloomy- white, edible rind. You get a cheese that is creamy and decadent with a rich, buttery quality-perfect as an ap- petizer or dessert. Serve it with fresh or dried fruit, nuts, crusty bread, or crisp crackers. The crisp acidity of a sparkling wine is the perfect complement to this extra creamy Brie.

Before we get into those details, though, let's talk cheese. The lush, green pastures of New Zealand's organic dairy farms are where this Cheddar truly begins. The milk used to produce this distinctive cheese comes from cows raised on family owned dairies and treated to a diet of the abundant organic clover and grasses that blanket the pastures. Moderate temperatures, flowing mountain streams, and abundant rainfall mean there's plenty of grazing to do year-round. Because of this diet, the cows produce incredibly rich and flavorful milk, and that milk, in turn, produces incredibly rich and flavorful cheese. Aged for three to six months, Trader Joe's New Zealand Organic Cheddar has a flavorful, fresh, and creamy profile that makes it a stand-out no matter how you choose to use it. Shred and make nachos with Organic Blue Corn Tortilla Chips [sku 94583], melt onto a burger, make a great mac 'n cheese, cut into cubes and enjoy as a midday snack.

But when you age goat cheese, something really interesting happens: The texture firms up to a semi-hard, extraordinarily toothsome consistency, and its innate tanginess grows more complex and takes on a riper, nuttier character. Such is the case with Trader Joe's Aged Kaas Goat's Milk Cheese, a Dutch goat cheese that's been aged a minimum of five months to give it a strikingly firm-yet-smooth texture and an artfully developed-yet-still-uniquely-goaty flavor profile. Made for us by a cheese cooperative in the southern Netherlands who specialize exclusively in goat cheese, this Kaas proves that aged goat cheese can be just as versatile as it is fresh. Its natural tanginess and creaminess make it a natural inclusion for cheese plates, as well as melted on sandwiches, shaved over salads, or even paired up with honey and preserves for a captivating sweet-savory treat. Typically, a cheese that demands such dedication and expertise would come with an exorbitant price tag, but at Trader Joe's, you can find our Aged Kaas Goat's Milk Cheese in random-weight pieces for $13.99* per pound.

We've been carrying Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese for decades because we believe the semi-soft texture and fresh, buttery flavors are a great representation of the hall(den)mark Danish cheese. The story of Danish Havarti is one of a noble 1800s exploit where a farmer based just north of Copenhagen traveled around the European continent in search for knowledge about cheesemaking. When she returned from her travels in 1852, she developed the technique to make the uniquely Danish Harvati Cheese. While this technique yielded a semi-firm cheese dotted with small holes, it is a bit different than what's modernly made as \"flødehavarti\" or \"cream Havarti\". Trader Joe's Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese with Dill is made using pasteurized milk that allows whey proteins to stick around that would otherwise be eliminated while processing the curd, giving it a signature creamy texture and taste. Ripened very little, cream Havarti Cheese has a mellow, buttery aroma, much like that of Swiss cheese, and a sweet, creamy, paste with mild saltiness and nutty notes. While we love the simplicity of our traditional Creamy Danish Havarti Cheese [sku 09356], it is a variety of cheese often adorned with added flavors such as the herby, grassy quality of dill.

   "description": "So often, at least here in the States, Iberico Cheese is overshadowed by its Manchego cheese sibling. And while we love to sell a variety of aged Manchego cheeses, the days of sibling rivalry are nevermore inside a Trader Joe's cheese case! Labeled \"Queso Iberico\" in its native La Mancha region of Spain, this Iberian delight is one of the most favored cheeses in Spain. Made from a blend of pasteurized sheep, cow, and goat's milk, Trader Joe's Iberico Cheese is already set up for a unique flavor and texture blend achieved only by using the trifecta of these milk sources. The cow's milk lends to a touch of acidity, but just enough to bring complexity. Buttery notes and intense flavor come from the sheep's milk. And last, but not least, a bit of barnyard piquancy is brought to the party with the addition of goat's milk. After this barnyard bash of cheeses join forces, the Iberico Cheese is aged four months to further develop a caramel, nutty flavor and bring out the aforementioned complexities of each milk source. The rich, buttery texture is wonderful for a snacking cheese, grating cheese, or melted cheese. So find your favorite cheesy recipe or bottle of exotic wine and bring Iberian flavors to a dining room near you. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Iberico Cheese",

Many of these monks were pushed out of France during the French Revolution and chose to learn cheesemaking as a way to support themselves abroad. When they returned following the Bourbon Restoration in France, they brought their cheesemaking talents with them and created Port Salut. But enough with the history lesson, Port Salut cheese is here to make personal history for you and yours. This semi-soft cheese is produced in the form of disks weighing in at a whopping five pounds of the good stuff!

But hey, \"Pecorino\" simply defines Italian cheeses made from 100% sheep's milk and \"Romano\" just lets the cheese consumer know that the cheese is from Rome. So this oft grated, hard and salty Italian cheese is, in all respects, a sheep's milk cheese from Rome; Trader Joe's Grated Pecorino Romano, ladies and gentlemen. While this \"ewe\"phoric ovine cheese is recognized and protected by European law, it doesn't have to be made in Rome; 97% of Pecorino Romano is actually made in Sardinia. Of the four Pecorino cheeses that have Protected Designation of Origin certification, Pecorino Romano is the most ancient as well as the most famous outside of its homeland, Italy. Our supplier uses 100% fresh, unpasteurized sheep's milk for each portion of our Grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Each wheel is dry-salted by hand numerous times, resulting in a fabulously salty flavor. Young Pecorino Romano has a soft, rubbery texture and sweet flavor, but gets progressively sharper and smokier with age. Our Grated Pecorino Romano is aged a minimum of eight months to still have that sweet, young cheese essence, but stacked with sharp and salty notes. Because of its granular, grated texture and saltiness, this cheese works wonders as a dusting over pasta, breads, and casseroles, or possibly in a dish paired with a glass of bold Italian wine or a light beer. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.",

While you may find similar cheeses produced outside of Italy (and the EU) labeled \"Parmesan\", these are not the same as authentic Parmigiano Reggiano, which by law may only be made under strict regulations in the regions surrounding Parma and Reggio-Emilia in northern-central Italy. Italian's call true Parmigiano Reggiano the \"King of Cheeses\" which, for a country known for their cuisine, and specifically cheeses, is not a label they're likely to slap on anything edible. And that's exactly why we source Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio that is produced by a century-old cheese company in the province of Parma. Raw (unpasteurized) cow's milk is curdled, drained, and packed into round molds reading for aging. And the aging, itself, is what makes this cheese a cut above. Notice that term you've never heard before: \"stravecchio\". It means \"very old\" in Italian (or \"very mature\" when describing cheese) and is used to let the buyer know that this cheese has been aged a full 36 months before hitting the market. We know what you're thinking, \"unaged Parm is already so good, why do I have to wait three more years?\" And to that we say just try a bite and you'll understand why. Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio is more mellow than a younger Parmesan and lacks the acidity and pale color of a young cheese. The extra aging brings to the cheese a fuller, more complex taste, grainy texture, and plenty of desirable crunchy amino acid crystals found in hard Parmesan. There's a reason this is called the \"King of Cheeses\", and wouldn't you love to find out why? *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.",

They start a family business and build it up for decades, sometimes centuries. And they all claim to have a special recipe under wraps known by only one person on this planet. While Old Amsterdam Aged Gouda is owned and operated by the Westland family, and it does have a magnificent, proprietary production process, it is surely more than just a run-of-the-mill family-made cheese. Every wedge of Old Amsterdam Aged Gouda is a toothsome blend of firm texture, deep color, and smooth, rich, and robust flavors of nutty-ness and caramel. Made from that secret family recipe, Old Amsterdam Aged Gouda is made relatively similar to other goudas. Pasteurized milk with added rennet and cheese cultures. Old Amsterdam prides itself in having found what they deem the perfect cultures for their Aged Gouda. Where things differ, however, is a secret, unique ripening process that is aged for approximately eight months. But because perfection cannot be rushed, a batch is not released until Old Amsterdam's master cheese makers deem it market ready. Once market ready, we proudly receive and stock Old Amsterdam Aged Gouda in a variety of wedges just waiting to unleash its smooth texture and mildly creamy flavors on our shoppers.

It begins its life as a pasteurized whole milk cheese that originates in Gloucestershire County, England. It's a golden yellow, semi-hard cheese that is similar to cheddar, but not quite as hard. The \"double\" variety is aged longer than \"Single Gloucester\" which lends to a firmer cheese with a stronger, more savory flavor. The flavors of our Cotswold Double Gloucester are creamy, buttery, sweet and mild, yet full-flavoured like a cheddar cheese. With the added onions and chives, each bite has an extra-savory zing guaranteed to satisfy. Double Gloucester is a common pub cheese in England, making an iteration such as our Cotswold Double Gloucester a wonderful pairing with any beer or a bold Zinfandel, Shiraz, or Chardonnay.

We consider ourselves lucky to stock this French national treasure of a super fine fromage. Using specific Penicillium roqueforti from the natural caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in France, Société Roquefort achieves an enchanting emerald veining throughout each wedge that is almost as visually mesmerizing as it is on the tastebuds. The emerald Penicillium roqueforti flows through an equally gorgeous cream-colored paste made from 100% ewe's milk. Using sheep's milk brings an intense, buttery flavor with a superbly creamy texture compared to cow's milk, despite the aging process zapping some moisture from the cheese. The tangy mold contrasts with the creamy and salty qualities of the sheep's milk used. Aged at least 90 days, the entire process of maturation, cutting, and subsequent packaging must take place in the commune of Roquefort- sur-Soulzon (the site of the caves and mold used) to abide by production regulation. Société Roquefort is still aged in 12,000 m2 of caves constructed way back in the Middle Ages. After all is said and done and the cheese has aged a few months, Société Roquefort crosses the pond to be available on your neighborhood Trader Joe's shelves ready to enjoy. \"Goûtez les plaisirs du Roquefort.\" And to that we say: don't threaten us with a good time. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Trader Joe's Gruyère Cheese is our Gruyère offering, bringing the Alpine cheese all-star to live amongst our cheese cases and be discovered by our shoppers for a creamy, nutty experience they can find nowhere else. An inimitable flavor and made with the utmost regard for quality, Trader Joe's Gruyère Cheese production can be distilled into a few simple parts: the use of high quality cow's milk; curdling of the milk in copper vats; cutting, mixing, and heating the curds; placing the paste into molds; bathing in salt and beginning the cheese's storage; and maturation in aging cellars. The six month aging process for our Gruyère is one of the most important steps. It's done in very humid environments to make for a moist, supple cheese with that intense flavor only achievable by aging. Not every cheese turns to a warm, decadent, ooey gooey pool of delight that you want to dive and dip into, but with Gruyère, we do get that pleasure. It takes a cheese made with rennet (as opposed to a cheese curdled with acid) to be a melting cheese, and then it takes a cheese with a high water-to-fat ratio to be a good melting cheese.

For one stop in our cheese-fueled world tour, we visited the Netherlands, the iconic home of windmills, tulip booms, and Trader Joe's 1,000 Day Gouda Cheese. It was there that we found the veteran cheese makers who hold the secret to ideal affinage-the art of caring for aging cheese-necessary for aging Gouda for such a prolonged period of time. During the maturation process, the cheese loses close to a quarter of its original weight, as its moisture content slowly but surely evaporates, condensing its naturally salty, caramel-y, and supremely savory flavor profile, without drying out completely. It's an intricate balance, and one that produces an unbelievably flavorful cheese. It's a long journey from the Dutch aging cellars to our cheese case, but it's a journey well worth taking. It's a delicious enough cheese that you may just find yourself idly snacking on it (we certainly won't judge), but if you're in the mood for a more organized setting, we recommend serving this Gouda as part of a dessert cheese plate, paired with a full-flavored Barolo wine, or as part of the most intense grilled cheese sandwich you've ever eaten. You can find Trader Joe's 1,000 Day Gouda Cheese at your neighborhood Trader Joe's for $11.99 per pound-by the far, the best price we've seen for a cheese of this quality and prestige.",

   "description": "Our Trader Joe's triple cream brie is a triple crème soft ripened cheese with wild porcini and chanterelle mushrooms. The earthy flavors of the mushrooms mingle happily with the velvety creaminess. The cheese ripens beautifully due to the unique process used to make it. Aromas of traditional brie are typically earthy with hints of mushroom. When you add real wild mushrooms to the mix, the aroma and flavors are magnified. Porcini is by far the more obvious flavor, producing beefy, brothy moist earth flavors. The chanterelles are more subtle and are present on the finish with hints of artichoke. The cheese itself shows the bet characteristics of a triple crème; great mouth feel and smooth creamy buttery flavor. At $8.99 per pound, this decadent triple cream mushroom brie is an all around WOW!",

Le Gruyère Switzerland AOC Cheese is our Gruyère offering, bringing the Medieval Alpine cheese to live amongst our cheese cases and be discovered by our shoppers for a creamy, nutty flavor they can find nowhere else. An inimitable flavor and made with the utmost regard for quality, Le Gruyère AOC's production can be distilled into eight simple parts: the use of high quality, part skim cow's milk; curdling of the milk in copper vats; cutting, mixing, and heating the curds; placing the paste into molds; bathing in salt and beginning the cheese's storage; maturation in aging cellars; taxation by experts to denote that the cheese is of the quality to bear the Le Gruyère AOC name; and additional maturation time, if chosen. Not every cheese turns to a warm, decadent, ooey gooey pool of delight that you want to dive and dip into, but with Gruyère, we do get that pleasure.

Trader Joe's Moisturizing Gel with Aloe does just that. This Aloe might look a bit different, but all that's changed is what's on the outside: a new name, and a new, blue bottle. Inside, it's the same great formula we sold last year. It's light & non-comedogenic, offering up all the soothing, moisturizing & skin- cooling properties that ingredients like Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, menthol, allantoin, calendula flower extract, & arnica montana flower extract can provide. And unlike other Aloe gels on the market, ours is made without artificial dyes (don't let the blue bottle fool you-it's clear), parabens, or pthalates. For cooling relief on hot, sunny days, store a bottle of Trader Joe's Moisturizing Gel with Aloe in the fridge before using. Ahhhhh...better? We thought so. But you don't need to wait for the sun to come out to apply this classic Gel; for a dewy, refreshed look, apply it liberally every day. Go ahead and enjoy your good day in the sunshine. When you're done, head to TJ's and pick up a 12-fluid ounce bottle of Aloe Vera Gel for the very good price of $2.99. You'll find it in our health & beauty section.",

We've updated its packaging from plastic to a more sustainable, gift-worthy, kraft paper wrap, so next time you go to stock up, it may look slightly different from what you're used to. However, the formula remains unchanged, with one important exception-rather than being made in the U.S. using a French recipe, the Soap is now being made for us in France, a country lauded for their superior soap-making skills. The French milling process refines the texture of this cream-colored Bar, ensuring a long-lasting, luxurious lather every time you suds up. Bits of colloidal oatmeal are visible throughout, which provide gentle exfoliation and create silky smooth skin, while the pleasant Almond Ginger Scent leaves you feeling (and smelling) like you spent a day at the spa-without the price tag, of course.

And while Argan Oil may be all the rage these days, it's more than just a flash-in-the-pan product- it's an age-old Moroccan beauty secret. Allegedly first discovered for use by the Phoenicians in 1550 B.C., Argan Oil has been an Eastern Hemisphere cosmetic (and culinary) staple for centuries. The fruit of the argan tree (Argania spinosa L.) is small, round, fleshy, and anchored by a hard \"nut.\" Each nut contains one to three small argan kernels, and workers must access these kernels in order to extract the oil. Most attempts to mechanize this process have been unsuccessful, so workers typically still peel the fruit and crack the nuts by hand. Our supplier purchases oil from various Moroccan women's cooperatives, and every last drop of it is USDA-certified organic. Unlike other cosmetic oils (Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E Oil, Coconut Oil, etc.), Argan Oil is noticeably silky, lightweight, and non-greasy; it absorbs quickly, and yet is still deeply moisturizing. Use it in place of face and/or body lotion. Smooth it into wet or dry hair to moisturize and tame frizz. Rub it onto dry, chapped hands and cuticles. This vitamin E and fatty acid-rich oil isn't called \"liquid gold\" for nothing...it does it all. We're selling each 1.7-fluid ounce bottle of Organic Argan Oil for just $6.99. This comes to about $4 per ounce, which is an unheard of value-we've never seen it sold for any less than $7 per ounce, and these versions are often non-organic, chock full of additives, and/or overwhelmed by added fragrance.

This is another excellent example of why having our products in the Trader Joe's label is such a winning scenario for you, our Customers. It works like this¿ Because Refresh Citrus Body Wash is in our private label-freeing the supplier from pack- aging, marketing or advertising costs-we're able to negotiate a ridiculously low price for what is a truly great quality product.

As your body's largest and fastest-growing organ, your skin regulates your temperature, permits various sensations, and protects you from microbes and the elements. It puts in overtime for you, so why not return the favor by incorporating Trader Joe's Nourish Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum into your skincare routine? One of the greatest challenges to maintaining great skin-particularly on the face-is keeping it moisturized. The game plan here is simple, really: do all that you can to lock in your skin's natural moisture, then add to it as needed. Hyaluronic acid (H.A.) does a little bit of both. A gram of the stuff can attract and hold onto several liters of water., and it helps form a light, non-greasy protective barrier on the skin. Our water-based, unscented, never-tested-on- animals, non-comedogenic Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum was formulated by top dermatologists to contain 1% sodium hyaluronate-which is the greatest possible percentage of the pure, salt form of H.A. that we can use without causing the product to bead. Sodium hyaluronate has an even lower molecular weight than hyaluronic acid, so it can penetrate the skin more easily than H.A. can. It's just what your pretty-but-parched visage needs. Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum can be used in conjunction with any and all components of your regular beauty regime, but it particularly complements other products from the TJ's Nourish line. Twice a day, cleanse with All-In-One Facial Cleanser [sku 96404], apply a small amount of Serum to your entire face (and Antioxidant Facial Serum [sku 51150] if desired), then follow with a liberal application of Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer [sku 56285].

It replaces the typical two-step shampoo and conditioner hair-care ritual with one product that simultaneously cleans and conditions, leaving your hair soft and shiny! Many shampoos contain detergents that strip hair of its natural oils, which often leads to dry strands and itchy scalps. Our Hair Wash doesn't contain any detergents, sulfates, parabens, or silicone-so you're left with clean hair, minus the harsh side effects that result from shampoo overuse. Products like this one are often referred to as \"co-washes\"-conditioners that are used to both wash and condition hair-and they're becoming a popular alternative for good reason. By co-washing, your hair won't need to be washed as frequently. It will hydrate dry hair and help tame frizz while enhancing texture and adding volume. To use our Cleansing & Conditioning Hair Wash, simply wet your hair and apply it to your hair and scalp. It won't foam up like typical shampoos (that's what detergents do); it will feel more like a creamy conditioner. Enjoy the invigorating grapefruit and minty scent while you massage it into your hair and scalp then rinse thoroughly. Pick up a tube in our health and beauty section.

When the price began to climb, and we could no longer offer it at a value to our customers, we made room on our shelves for new products. We've brought in some great stuff since then, but still, the requests rolled in: \"We want Castile Soap!\" you said. Well, folks, it's your lucky day-please put your soon-to-be-squeaky-clean hands together for our Castile comeback: Trader Joe's Multi- Purpose Peppermint Castille Soap! For those unfamiliar, Castile Soap has historically been referred to as \"true soap.\" The first versions were made centuries ago in the Castile region of Spain, using local olive oil; however, by the turn of this century, \"Castile\" had come to reference any vegetable oil-based soap, as opposed to the animal fat-based soaps of the previous era. Today, Trader Joe's Multi-Purpose Peppermint Castile Soap is made with a gentle, nourishing blend of organic olive, coconut, hemp, and jojoba oils, plus organic peppermint oil to invigorate your senses. It's a low-lather soap, free from synthetic dyes and fragrances, and when we say it's Multi-Purpose, we mean it. You can use it as a body wash, shampoo, household cleaner, laundry cleaner, and more.

That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet.\" (From Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare) Will was getting to the bottom of things-their essence. The larger discussion was about people (with last names like Montague), but he chose a rose to make his point. Whatever you call them, Roses draw our noses with sweet perfume, enticing our eyes with bright color. Trader Joe's makes it easy for you to experience and share a variety of Roses this Valentine's Day. For instance, we are offering beautiful bouquets in sundry shades of Pink. Each bouquet has One Dozen Roses-all the same pink-shade-with greens for contrast. The overall assortment of Pinks includes a pale blush, to a bright \"hot pink,\" with several shades inbetween. No matter the shade, Pink Roses convey love, joy, and gratitude. Choose the hue that strikes your fancy, or that matches the personality of the one with whom you'll share it. To the receiver, the particular Pink probably won't matter; not as much as the simple fact that they just received roses. A pink rose of any shade would smell as sweet!

In addition to its usefulness in deli-style situations, our Marble Rye also makes a great option for your breakfast toast, especially when served with butter and jam. It also works wonders when used for avocado toast with sliced cherry tomatoes and a light sprinkling of Nutritional Yeast [sku 58871], or even when simply topped with a thin layer of Organic Light Whipped Cream Cheese [sku 44675] and a few pieces of your favorite smoked fish from our deli section. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Trader Joe's Organic Low Sodium Chicken Broth is a flavorful broth that's made for us from organically raised chickens and organic vegetables like celery, onions, and carrots. We have this Low Sodium Organic version as well as a straight Organic version. They're virtually identical, except for the salt. Some folks like to have the option to add their own salt (or not), and others like to have it there when they start cooking. Both of our Organic Chicken Broth options add terrific flavor to basics like mashed potatoes or rice, and make great bases for sauces, gravies, and all kinds of soups. They are both gluten free (believe it or not, some broths have added gluten), and the Low Sodium version comes with a mere 50mg of sodium per serving. So whether you're mashing potatoes, boiling rice or making a signature soup creation, you'll find a helping hand in Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Broth and Low Sodium Chicken Broth. They even come in convenient 32-ounce containers, with resealable pour spouts - no can opener required here. We're selling each one for the excellent everyday price of $1.99 - we haven't seen an everyday price this low anywhere else. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Making soup from scratch is a lovely, romantic notion. In theory. In practice, it gets a little more complicated. It generally involves spending long hours in the kitchen, plenty of chopping and dicing, copious amounts of stirring, and did we mention long hours standing in the kitchen? If you have the time on your hands, we're all for homemade. We love homemade. But if, like us, you don't always have the time, we have some homey fully- cooked-and-ready-to-heat soups that will warm you inside and out. One of our favorites is Trader Joe's Organic Low Sodium Tomato & Roasted Red Pepper Soup. It's a velvety smooth concoction with a subtle tomato base. Its depth of flavor comes from the flavorful spices and the slightly sweet finish is courtesy of the Roasted red bell peppers. The companion, full-sodium version of this soup on our shelves has 710mg of sodium per serving. This version has only 105mg. If you're looking to cut your sodium intake, this is a huge help. You can serve it as is, or add big chunks of veggies and some beans to make it even heartier. A dollop of sour cream or crème fraîche never hurts. Our price won't hurt, either.

We're not talking about a night at the opera, but about the cherished micro-organisms, also found in yogurt and crème fraîche, which unleash depth and a pleasant tang in cream. Beyond the enviable culture-elicited flavor, butter is better when churned and churned and churned and¿ Lengthier churning lowers the moisture content, increasing the butterfat, and resulting in luxuriously creamy texture. And because one good churn deserves another, we're bringing Trader Joe's Cultured Salted Butter back to our dairy shelves, after a brief (and what some might call heartbreaking) hiatus. Trader Joe's Cultured Salted Butter is lightly salted, subtly tangy, enviably creamy, and it's made for us in French dairy country, Brittany. You can use it in any culinary application that calls for butter; this Butter shines served simply on its own and in baking recipes. Slather it atop a piece of toasted, thick bread, like our French Baguette [sku 53835], and take a bite-it's an ethereal experience. It's also wonderful enjoyed melted as a dip for mild, peppery Organic Radishes of Many Colors [sku 61844].

When they recently began the search for a deliciously creamy, sublimely spreadable, and (most importantly) veritably vegan butter alternative, it meant tasting through every non- dairy spread on the market until they found the absolute best of the absolute best. It can be a daunting process, to be sure, but as Trader Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread demonstrates, the results are well worth it. Crafted for us by an expert supplier in Germany, this Spread is made from a mix of vegan ingredients including sunflower, coconut, and canola oil, which are mixed with a bit of shea butter, fava bean protein, and just a touch of salt to give it an impeccably buttery flavor. What truly sets this Spread apart, however, is the fact that you can use it as a 1:1 replacement for traditional dairy-based butter in every way you can think of. It melts like a dream, spreads beautifully over bread, and helps create moist and delicious (not to mention perfectly plant- based) baked goods. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Carefully balanced for a supremely smooth texture and mild, creamy flavor, each batch is made from a harmonious mix of organic coconut, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, and sustainably-sourced palm fruit oils, plus just a touch of salt to give it that fresh-from-the-crock feeling. Together, this finely tuned blend creates a profoundly Buttery profile that's ideal for spreading over any breakfast bagel, midday muffin, or dinner roll. As you might surmise from the fact that it's Plant-Based, this Spread is totally free of dairy and lactose, and we should also mention that it's gluten-free, soy-free, and kosher (pareve), too. In addition to its appetizing applications on a warm slice of toast or pile of pancakes, we've found its already soft consistency makes it a great tool for crafting vegan compound butters.

   "description": "Ah, for the simple pleasures of a summertime picinic. There's just something about the act of eating outside, amongst nature and friends and family, that makes one feel a little more at peace with the world. Of course, we certainly feel even more at peace with the world when we've got a nice napkin to go along with all that (potentially messy) nature and food and fellowship-and that's precisely why we're introducing Trader Joe's Cotton Picnic Cloths to our shelves for the summer season. Made for us by an expert supplier in Tunisia, these woven, hand-finished, 100% Cotton Picnic Cloths are super soft, and only grow softer every time you wash them. Each package contains two 18-inch by 24-inch Cloths, perfectly sized for serving as a napkin, placemat, or serving cloth, which come in a gorgeous, gingham design and are available in three vibrant colors: a bright blue, a rich red, and a summer citrus-y yellow. And while we're especially excited about their prospects at a picnic, cookout, or barbecue, they're equally excellent as an everyday, all-purpose kitchen towel, too. Cotton Picnic Cloths",

   "description": "You'll find canned salmon in all kinds of stores. You could say that Trader Joe's Sockeye Salmon comes in a can. We'd prefer that you didn't. We think this fish is too special to put in a can, and so, while it may look like a can, we prefer to call it a tin. Doesn't that sound better? To be sure, it's the same material, but let's face it, words matter. In this case, tin evokes a more civilized package, one you can bring with you to work or keep in your pantry for those times when you want good fish and you want it quickly. To be clear, as much as we want to reference the packaging appropriately, we're much more concerned with accurately describing the package's contents, because inside this tin is some delicious Salmon. It's wild-caught Sockeye Salmon caught off the coast of Alaska's Bristol Bay, where the icy cold waters are sustainably fished according to guidelines that are actually included in Alaska's constitution. These fish are delivered to the cannery (tannery?) on the day they're caught, and processed quickly to retain the freshest flavor and texture. It's a step (or two) above much of the canned salmon you'll see elsewhere, rich in salmon flavor and meaty, flaky texture. Open a tin and mix it with mayo and seasonings to make salmon salad; use that salad for a sandwich or atop a bed of greens. Make salmon cakes without having to cook fresh salmon. It's excellent as an ingredient in chowders or soups. You'll find each 7.5-ounce tin of Sockeye Salmon , every day in our grocery aisle. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Sockeye Salmon",

In line with this goal, we have worked closely with a prominent, sustainable-focused fishery to change our procurement of Yellowfin Tuna from long-line catch methods to pole-and-line catch methods. Pole and line fishing methods use nylon leads and circle hooks, which greatly reduces the incidence of by-catch. Not only do the fishermen catch one fish at a time, but if they accidentally do catch an unwanted species, they can release them back into the ocean. While the fishing methods have changed, the fish inside the can reflects the same exceptional quality our customers have come to expect. Recognized for their yellow-tipped fins, large size (they can reach up to 400 lbs and 90 inches, fully grown), and fast swimming speeds, Yellowfin Tuna flesh is tender, light and pale pink. We pack our Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil with a touch of salt (that's it!) to preserve its delicate, meaty flavor and firm, flaky texture. It's a premium, sustainably-sourced catch for a pocket-friendly price-$2.29 for a five ounce can.",

We know, though, that not all canned tuna is created equal. And we think Trader Joe's Skipjack Tuna is a catch above the rest. Skipjack mature faster and are smaller than most tuna, which results in a healthy, abundant population of fish that are naturally lower in mercury. Better yet, our Skipjack Tuna is being caught the old-fashioned way, with fishing poles. The pole and line fishing methods use nylon leads and circle hooks, which greatly reduces the incidence of by-catch. Not only do the fishermen catch one fish at a time, but if they accidentally do capture an unwanted species, they can release them back into the ocean. The difference in our catch is also in the can. Trader Joe's Skipkack is packed in water with a pinch of sea salt. Others frequently use soy broth so that the fish will retain more water weight.

If not, Trader Joe's Lightly Smoked Mussels are the perfect opportunity to flex a little. They're harvested for us by a trusted supplier off the shores of Puerto Montt in southern Chile, then given a light smoking over applewood chips before packing them in olive oil. This process not only imparts a deliciously subtle smokiness to each Mussel, but also draws out their moisture, creating a firm, yet tender, must-be-tasted-to-be-believed texture. In addition to making a great snack on their own, or placed on a cracker with a bit of cream cheese, these Lightly Smoked Mussels can be added to fish stews and pasta sauces to bring a nice touch of smokiness to the proceedings.

And believe us - this Salmon ever-so-certainly succeeds. It's brought to us by a supplier in Chile, who cooks their farm-raised, lightly salted salmon in whole, skinless, boneless fillets to make the most of their firm-yet-flaky texture. They then smoke these fillets over applewood chips for just long enough to impart a delicately smoky note, then pack them in olive oil for your shelf-stable convenience.

But in Europe, calamari (which simply means \"squid\" in Italian) refers more generally to squid in a variety of culinary forms. And at Trader Joe's, Calamari Pieces in Olive Oil refers to an excellent 'tinned-fish' value that is simple, convenient, and delicious! In the tin are Humboldt-variety squid (aka 'Giant Squid'), which are caught off the coast of Spain using the traditional jigging method. Fishers drop lines with multiple lures deep into the ocean and 'jiggle' to attract the squid. The large tentacles of the captured Calamari are cleaned & cooked just enough to yield a firm, yet tender texture. They're cut into 1.5-centimeter chunks and packed with extra virgin olive oil & salt. The mild, slightly briny flavor and tender, meaty texture of Trader Joe's Calamari Pieces in Olive Oil should win over even the most 'tin-ative' tasters; especially when incorporated into a charcuterie board with toasted Organic Baguette slices [sku 53835], Mini Heirloom Tomatoes [sku 91008], Colossal Garlic -Stuffed Olives [sku 01610], and fresh lemon wedges.

Trader Joe's Dolmas are made by a Greek company in Evia, the isle shaped like a seahorse. Okay, they're not just any Greek company; they're the largest Dolmas (Ntolmadakia) producer in the world, with more than 50 years of experience under their vine leaves. They deliver authenticity and are adept in their stuffing of somethings. Trader Joe's Dolmas are crafted according to an age-old, Mediterranean recipe, using tender vine leaves. By hand, the leaves are stuffed, one by one, with a soft, succulent white rice that's mixed with chopped onions, bits of dill and mint. Dexterously rolled and folded, the leaves and rice are transformed into two-bite morsels, which are cooked to marry flavors and create a moist, tender bite. Packed in soy oil, they eat like they were freshly prepared and promise a little spice, a little savory and a little tang. Enjoy them cold, as a snack, or serve them warm with a dipping sauce - Tzatziki, Lemon Tahini (tahini, lemon juice & garlic - blended), or Greek Yogurt & Dill - for an iconic meze.

If you haven't yet been sold on the pleasures of beans, Trader Joe's Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce makes a mouthwatering case. Our Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce is modeled after the traditional Greek dish called gigandes plaki; although, we've adjusted the recipe a bit, as we do. Our supplier (in Greece!) takes cannellini beans (in place of traditional, smaller runner beans), and soaks and boils them until they are plump and soft, not to mention Giant (relatively speaking, of course). These big Beans are combined with a Tomato Sauce that includes strips of onion, and finely chopped parsley and dill. It's seasoned with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. This simple, yet delectable, mixture is baked to a rich consistency and finally, canned for you. Canned? you say. Don't let the can fool you. This ready-to-eat dish with its smooth, aromatic sauce; cubes of peeled tomatoes; and tender, melt-in-your-mouth beans does not disappoint-even enjoyed at room temperature, straight out of the can.

   "description": "If you are a fan of our canned products from Greece, including Dolmas [sku 50752], Giant Baked Beans [sku 56278], and Greek Style Eggplant [sku 53896], you're likely to love Trader Joe's Greek Chickpeas with Parsley & Cumin. Like those other products, the can contains simple ingredients. In this case, it's chickpeas in soybean oil and lemon juice-seasoned with parsley, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and black pepper. That's it! Ingredient-wise, it's very similar to what goes into a typical hummus. Instead of being mashed, the chickpeas, here, are left whole for a completely different texture. Being already dressed and seasoned, our Greek Chickpeas are ready, right out of the can, to be a side dish for a Mediterranean-style meal. Add some fresh, chopped, Organic Persian Cucumbers [sku 91838], halved Organic Cherry Tomatoes [sku 12155], and Organic Riced Cauliflower [sku 54541], if you like. Use these Greek Chickpeas to top the greens in our Organic Mediterranean Style Salad Kit [sku 62016]. Or, alternatively, use our Crumbled Feta Cheese with Mediterranean Herbs [sku 39633] to top a bowl of these Greek Chickpeas! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "We asked one of our snack suppliers to create organic taco shells for us, and they really came through. After all, this supplier is used to working with corn masa to make crispy chips, and the like. In this case, they channeled their masterful masa skills into making Trader Joe's Organic Stone Ground Yellow Corn Taco Shells. These Shells are simple, made with 100% organic ingredients, including: organic stone-ground yellow corn, organic sunflower and/or organic safflower oil, and a trace of lime. Our supplier's handling of the corn flour, and their expert approach to cooking it in expeller-pressed oil, has culminated in a light, crisp, crunchy texture. The classic, hard-shell-taco shape is ideal for filling with ground beef, shredded cheese & lettuce, salsa, and guacamole to ensure a stellar-or might we say, \"shellar\"-taco night! We're selling 5.5-ounce boxes of twelve Organic Stone Ground Yellow Corn Taco Shells everyday at Trader Joe's. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

When we were forced to find a new supplier for our shelf- stable, private-label Grated Parmesan Cheese, we initially partnered with the Colonna Brothers® to bring in their version of the product until we could create a perfect Parm. of our own. Well, Dear Customers, the day for Perfect Parm has finally arrived! Unlike most big-brand versions of Parmesan-in-a-jar, Trader Joe's Grated Parmesan Cheese is free of potassium sorbate, a preservative often added to mantain flavor and shelf-life. Like all of our private-label dairy products, it's also made only with milk from cows not treated with rBST. Call us cheesy, but we'd say that's a double win! Whether you plan to pour it over pasta, sprinkle it on a salad, or mix it into mac-'n-cheese, the price on Trader Joe's Grated Parmesan Cheese should put a winning smile on your face, too-we're selling the stuff in eight- ounce, shakeable jars for $2.99* each.

And that's exactly what we have with Trader Joe's Sweet Picanté Peppers with Creamy Cheese Filling. On their own, these crisp, perfectly pickled Picanté Peppers (try saying that three times, fast!) would be a delicious enough treat, with their balanced profile of peppery and sweet, but when you add the slightly tart notes and plush texture of the Cheese Filling inside, that's where things get taken to the next level. With all those intersections of flavors and textures, it should come as no surprise that these Peppers are remarkbly versatile: they can be enjoyed entirely on their own as an anytime snack, arranged on an antipasto platter or tapas spread as an appetizer, or as a topping on pizza. We also find that they're delicious when sliced and served on a sandwich, and great when used as agarnish for salads, or if you're particularly adventurous, plopped into a cocktail.

We'd had some great success with delivering hearty, shelf-stable soups in sturdy glass jars; we decided this was the path to follow. Several soups successfully sailed through our tasting panel, and now Trader Joe's Garden Vegetable Soup has finally landed on our shelves. This Garden Vegetable Soup truly is a veritable garden, ready to slurp with a spoon. It's filled with hearty chunks of sweet potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes, zucchini, red bell peppers, and leeks; it also includes leafy greens: kale, Swiss chard, and spinach. The broth is made with a slow-simmered blend of tomatoes, carrots, celery, and onions, accented with herbs and spices, and finished with olive oil. This is the Vegetable Soup you'd make at home if you had time to make soup. Since we've done the work for you, scrumptuous soup is as easy as twist, pour, heat, and slurp. Delicious!

   "description": "Apple Sauce often gets pigeon-holed as being nothing more than a dessert, and a kid's dessert at that. Nothing could be further from the truth: apple sauce has a wide variety of uses, both sweet and savory. It goes great with roasted potatoes, is a true treat when warmed and served over cold ice cream, the Dutch even like to serve it with french fries. In fact, its original intended use, from its invention in the 1700s, as a true \"sauce\" to serve with roasted meats, remains one of its best. Need further proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Apple Sauce. Unlike other apple sauces out there, this Apple Sauce is made with one ingredient and one ingredient only: organic apples. It has a light, easy texture, and a naturally sweet (and slightly tart) pure apple flavor. With no added sweeteners, the apples are truly allowed to shine, making them a great choice for sweet and savory applications. In addition to making a great dessert or after-school snack, our Organic Unsweetened Apple Sauce makes an ideal for topping Potato Pancakes [sku 36084], Pork Loin Chops [sku 63395] or parfaits. Perhaps best of all, however, is the fact that we're selling 24-ounce jars for the stupendous price of $2.49*, every day.

The yellow Peaches are grown in the region of Valencia, Spain. The warm Mediterranean Sea produces sweet, flavorful peaches. And just what difference does it make where the fruit is grown? One taste and you'll understand. Our Peaches come from Valencia, one of the world's most revered fruit-growing regions. This area is known for its sweet fruit, and we're quite sure we've found the best Valencia has to offer. In fact, the fruit in these jars is so naturally sweet, so unburdened by the cloying sweetness of a heavy syrup, that we think these are a suitable substitute for fresh pretty much any time.

More recently, some brilliant person figured out how to put applesauce into handy, squeezable pouches. Trader Joe's picked up on this innovation early on, and the introduction of our Applesauce Crushers [sku 92541] was met with great excitement and success. It wasn't long before we created additional crushable flavors, including Apple Banana [sku 96161], Apple Strawberry [sku 97902], and Apple Carrot [sku 92540].

In fact, we've found two ways to improve them¿ First, we found a supplier who could make our Fruit Sauce Crushers with 100% Organic ingredients. With a new supplier and new ingredi- ents, our Tasting Panel took this opportunity to revisit each flavor profile. Where we didn't match the original flavor profile 100%, we improved the flavor.

In this case, we've not only been able to avoid the price bump, we've actually been able to lower the price!

While the name is derived from the Italian amara, meaning bitter, this cherry is renowned for profound cherry sweetness. The essential fruitiness is amplified when the fleshy drupes are preserved in rich, bright syrup crafted with their own juice. Considered the much more elevated and elegant cousins to maraschino cherries, Amarena Cherries have been in our sights for some time, especially with the recent renaissance of cocktail culture. We happened upon a trio of sisters in Napoli, who could deliver the trifecta: 1) pitted Amarena cherries 2) produced without artificial flavors 3) that taste truly sweet and very cherry. The cherry on top-as always, an incredible price: each 16.21 ounce jar of Trader Joe's Pitted Amarena Cherries with Stems is only $3.99. Already Pitted and with the Stems on, our Amarena Cherries are ready to be placed atop a bowl of ice cream or a slice of cheesecake or into your whiskey sour, rum swizzle, Singapore sling or Shirley Temple. De-stemmed and reduced, they will also make an amazing sauce for your Cornish Game Hen [sku 60952] or Brined Bone-In Center Cut Pork Loin Chop [sku 60982].

Here, the sun's natural heat does the same thing, and these Sun Dried Tomatoes have, ounce for ounce, 12 times the lycopene of raw tomatoes! The magic continues with the flavor transformation.

   "description": "¿ Certified San Marzano tomatoes can only be grown in the Valley of Sarno, at the base of Mount Vesuvius in Italy. They are the most important, sought-after, commercially grown tomato in the world. Foodies are fanatical about them. Certified San Marzanos are the only tomato that can be used on DOP Pizza of Naples. The history of the San Marzano tomato is a bit fuzzy, but it's thought that they might have originated in Peru, travelling to Italy several hundred years ago. It is well-known that San Marzano tomato seeds have since migrated, and are now grown worldwide (even here in the U.S). And modern-day Roma tomatoes are a cross of San Marzanos and two other tomato varieties. The reason Certified San Marzano tomatoes are so highly regarded is they taste great, and are very reliable. Year after year the San Marzano tomato plants in the Sarno Valley yield the best-tasting, evenly-ripening, sweet and rich tomatoes. The world's best pasta and pizza sauces are traditionally made from Certified San Marzano tomatoes. One of our vendors, Cento, is one of the largest distributors of San Marzano tomatoes in the U.S., and we were able to negotiate a fantastic deal on a few truckloads (and we're still working on getting a few more) of their very best, and their most popular, tomatoes - Cento Certified Whole, Peeled, Salted, San Marzano Tomatoes with Fresh Basil. $3.99 per 28 ounce can.",

That's a deal and a half, for less than a buck and a half. What's that? You're not yet an aficionado of this legendary legume? We'll guess, then, that you're at least a bit of a curiosity- seeker, right? And at 99¢ a can, our Organic Black Beans are custom-made for the frugal-but-curious. Scientifically known as Phaselous vulgari, black beans are quite popular in the cuisines of Latin and South America, as well as those of the American Southwest. Trader Joe's Organic Black Beans are low in sodium and a good source of fiber. They're tender and almost meaty in texture - this may very well be why they're a perennial favorite protein source for vegetarians. Or, it may be because they are so satisfying, whether enjoyed on their own or used in recipes. Or, it may have something to do with the fact that, at just under a buck a can, they're so wonderfully affordable. Serve them with rice, wrap them up in tortillas, or really go for the protein gold and serve them alongside a piece of grilled fish or lean pork chop.

   "description": "The only U.S. state with an official question is New Mexico. That question is simply, \"Red or green?\" This is not a question of stoplight preference or favorite Christmas tones; it refers to chiles. The chile is a pepper cultivar native to New Mexico. Ripe chiles are red, and can be quite spicy. Green chiles, on the other hand, are harvested before they reach ripeness. They can range in heat, but are typically not as hot as red chiles. Regardless of heat level, green chiles have a truly unique flavor all their own-one that complements and enhances a wide variety of recipes. Trader Joe's Fire Roasted Diced Green Chiles are ready right out of the can to be added to burgers, burritos, eggs, sandwiches, salsa, soups, stews... you name it! Our supplier in New Mexico harvests these Green Chiles in Southwest New Mexico, July through mid-October. They roast them over a flame, and peel off the skin before dicing and canning them. We carry cans of Fire Roast- ed Diced Green Chiles all year round, so you can add that great, green chile flavor to whatever you're making.

Well, time is on your side as Trader Joe's Minced Garlic fulfills all of your minced garlic needs without the need for any mincing by you. Garlic, while a delicious and vital ingredient in many recipes, is rather messy to handle. We've got the mincing part covered, sparing you from the strong-smelling side effects of garlic chopping. As experienced garlic-han- dlers may know, the way garlic is prepared affects its intensity in any given dish: the more the garlic is chopped, pressed, or pulverized, the more intense its flavor will be when used. Trader Joe's Minced Garlic is stronger than whole or sliced garlic cloves but milder than crushed or puréed garlic, giving dishes that sought-after garlic flavor without an overpowering intensity. With just a twist of a jar lid, our Minced Garlic is ready for action. One half of a teaspoon equals one clove of fresh garlic. Unlike some of our other products (Cookie Butter, we're looking at you), we do not recommend eat- ing this by the spoonful. Instead, use in pasta sauces and dishes, when braising meats and poultry-anywhere minced garlic is called for, really. We don't mince words here, just garlic.

Well, thanks to a palatable new pepper offering, we've decided to reword it. \"Trader Joe's picked a peck of Hot & Sweet Jalape- ños¿\" Sounds rather catchy, we think. The developers of our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños originally came upon a jar of candied jalapeños in Kansas City, Missouri. The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement-but not overpower-the heat of the jalapeños. And, yes, these are spicy; they'll certainly pack the punch you'd expect from the small but mighty jalapeño. Grown in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalapeños are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalapeño puree, garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled-and sweet-pepper. Perplexed about how to put our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños to use? Pop 'em in your mouth like candy. Top a heap- ing plate of nachos with several slices. Spice up a hamburger or grilled cheese. Add to guacamole. Serve with crackers and cream cheese. Place as a pickled accompaniment for charcuterie. And then, when the jalapeños are gone, use the brine for a marinade. The possibilities are plentiful! Though we don't sell Trader Joe's Hot & Sweet Jalapenos by the peck (sorry, Peter), we do sell 12 ounce jars for the phenomenal price of $2.49. What a sweet deal for such a hot item. 07.06. 16",

As the flames blacken bits of the skin, a twofold process plays out: first, the searing heat seals in the juiciness of the tomato, keeping it ripe and ready for use in sauces or soups. Second, the char leaves a nice smokiness and remnants of a maillard reaction that accentuate the tomato's natural sweetness. This one-two punch of fiery flavor is precisely what you'll find in every can of Trader Joe's Organic Crushed Fire Roasted Tomatoes, a doubly dependable pantry staple for whenever you need to make a marinara or start a stew. Our supplier uses only the freshest organic tomatoes to make each batch of these Crushed Fire Roasted Tomatoes, and we mean that - every tomato goes from the field to the can in eight hours or less. All that translates to ripe, robust flavor that takes tomato sauces to a whole new level. We're particularly fond of using it in chilis and pizza sauces, where its fire roasted edge adds an extra savory element. We're also quite fond of its value, of course: each 28-ounce can sells for $2.69*, every day.

Whether you're making pasta sauce, shakshuka, soup, pizza... tomatoes in a can can be conveniently stored in your pantry for months, at the ready for an unexpected moment of saucy inspiration. And canned tomatoes are not just a great option for their convenience, but they're also a great option for their quality-at least when we're talking about Trader Joe's Super Sweet Marzanino Tomatoes. You may recognize the name, which is related to the famous San Marzano tomatoes [sku 50244] grown in the volcanic soils of the Campania region of Italy. Our Marzaninos are actually a hybrid of the San Marzano tomato and Datterini (or \"little date\") tomato, named for its small size, elongated shape, and sweet, rich flavor. Crossing these two varieties yields a superb specimen, one that resembles a mini-Marzano, with its intensely red pulp, and concentrated, sweet flavor. In fact, these Marzanino Tomatoes possess the sweetest flavor of any canned tomato we've tried! Since they are peeled, whole, and preserved in tomato juice, Trader Joe's Super Sweet Marzanino Tomatoes are ready for just about any tomato related recipe. Open up the 14.1-ounce can, drain, and roughly cut the tomatoes to use as a homemade pizza topping. Or pop them in the blender to create a base for a fresh Mexican- style salsa. Of course, Marzaninos also make a wonderful addition to your homemade pasta sauces. Super Sweet Marzanino Tomatoes",

Part of the reason for this is that Italians use tomatoes in so many delicious dishes, from pasta & pizza sauces to salads & soups. Trader Joe's Italian Whole Peeled Tomatoes are not only ready to use in all those dishes and more, but they also possess the cachet that comes with being grown & packed in Italy! Each 28-ounce can is filled with juicy, deep-red, Roma tomatoes that are grown in the Puglia region of Italy (aka the 'heel of the boot'). These particular 'plump fruits' are picked at peak harvest near the end of summer. The Tomatoes are then quickly delivered to Naples, where they are peeled & packed with tomato juice and Basil Leaves. And by quickly, we mean they go from harvest-to-can in just 12 hours! The colorful cans are then delivered to your neighborhood Trader Joe's, where you can pick them up for use in the dishes your home is known for.

The number 2,984 may seem monotonously mountainous, but it must be a dynamic duo if people are willing to do it again and again (repeat again 2,982 times). We thought we would shake things up a bit, as we always do, and in the best way since peanut butter and jelly! How, you ask? With the Trader Joe's PB & J Bars, of course. Trader Joe's PB & J Bars are prepared with a lot of care, as most things containing peanut butter and jelly generally are (thanks to mom and dad for all those heartfelt, school-lunch sandwiches). The \"crusts\"-made with oats, peanut butter, rice flour, and peanut flour-sandwich a sweet, strawberry fruit filling reminiscent of jelly. Each nostalgically flavorful bite is soft, chewy, and sticky-but not too sticky to scare off archibutyrophobics (people with a fear of getting peanut butter stuck to the roof of their mouth). Trader Joe's PB & J Bars are just delightful to eat. Furthering the pleasing experience is a profile that boasts low sodium (55 milligrams), no cholesterol, and eight grams of whole grains per bar. Plus, they are certified gluten free and kosher (dairy). We're confident that kids of all ages will adore PB & J Bars, though we're not quite ready to estimate how many will be consumed in a lifetime. It's got to be a lot-especially at $2.69 for each 7.4 ounce box of six-1.2 ounce Trader Joe's PB & J Bars. Grab a bar on-the-go, as a snack, or dip one in your Peanut Butter and Jelly with Nonfat Greek Yogurt [sku 54103] for breakfast. 06.29. 16",

   "description": "What's in a name? When you're talking about Trader Joe's Organic Chocolate Chip Chewy Granola Bars, the answer is everything. This is our Product Developer's homage to the classic granola bar, with attributes that really up the ante, from a snacking perspective. Whole grain rolled oats and crisp brown rice flour are held together by tapioca syrup, agave syrup and honey, creating a delightfully toothsome, slightly sweet granola bar base. Each bar is dotted throughout with semi-sweet chocolate chips, so each bite has a generous amount of classic chocolate chip flavor, rounded out with a touch of unsweetened dried coconut. Yum. Upping the ante on this classic bar flavor is its certified Organic status-yes! It's also kosher (dairy) and has just 10mg sodium per 100-calorie bar-the sodium in other bars in the market ranges from from 65mg to 80mg. Each bar is individually wrapped, so you can stash them in your bag or desk drawer to keep snacky- sweet cravings at bay. Pair one with orange slices for a post-game pick-me-up, toss one in your lunchbox for a virtuous dessert, or go the classic afternoon snack route. What's not in this product's name, but an attribute of equal importance nonetheless? Value. We're selling 6.8 oz. boxes of Organic Chocolate Chip Chewy Granola Bars (eight bars, to be exact) for the WOW price of $2.49, everyday. You can find them on our Cereal shelves. 01.30. 17",

To that end, why shouldn't a cereal bar provide the same protein- packed pick-me-up of a protein bar? And while we're on the subject, why shouldn't we combine them into one convenient, tasty treat? At Trader Joe's, we don't just ask the tough questions, we answer them. Today, our answer comes in the form of Trader Joe's Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars, a delightfully delicious and properly proteinaceous cereal bar made from a mix of peanuts, soy protein, and brown rice protein that's flavored with the classic sweet-savory combo of dark chocolate and peanut butter. Each bite of one of our Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars starts out with the familiar soft texture of a granola or cereal bar, which gives way to the crunch of the peanuts and crispy soy, which itself turns to satisfying, mouth-filling chewiness. Add to that its almost candy-like peanut butter & chocolate profile and whopping 10 grams of protein per serving, and you've got a bar as utilitarian as it is delicious.

First introduced to the public at the notorious 1893 Chicago World's Fair, shredded wheat was originally only available in relatively larger, singular squares, that would be placed in a bowl with milk and broken up by the consumer with a spoon. At some point, some enterprising breakfast engineer found that the experience might be improved by pre-breaking the wheat biscuits down to bite-sized miniature wheats, an improvement that was further improved upon via the introduction of frosted sugar. Carrying on that tradition further, Trader Joe's Frosted Shredded Bite Size Wheats offer captivating crunch and satisfying sweetness to start your day off right. Perfectly sized to be enjoyed by the spoonful, and perfectly constructed to take on milk (or the non-dairy alternative of your choosing) without growing soggy, our Frosted Shredded Bite Size Wheats are a great (and delicious) way to get fiber into your morning routine. Sweet without being overpowering, crunchy without being too dry, they're an edible testament to why this cereal has remained a breakfast table classic for well over a century. We're selling 20.4-ounce boxes of Trader Joe's Frosted Shredded Bite Size Wheats for $2.99*, every day. Look for them in our cereal aisle. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

But then consider that each serving contains only one gram of fat, with no saturated or trans fats and we think you've entered triple crown territory.

These are all delicious treats, and each highlights in a special way the taste-relationship between PB & C. Missing here is anything tailor-made for breakfast-time enjoyment. With this top of mind, Trader Joe's Organic Peanut Butter & Cocoa Crunch really delivers, for breakfast and beyond. This cereal begins with Organic corn meal that's been sweetened and puffed into crunchy, bite-sized spheres. About half of the puffs are flavored with Organic Peanut Butter, and the other half with Organic fair trade Cocoa powder. This combo really delivers on your PB-Chocolate flavor expectations. (If it's even more chocolate flavor that you're after, we recommend swapping regular milk out for Trader Joe's Fair Trade Cocoa Chocolate Milk [sku 61673]. Each bowl of gluten free Peanut Butter & Cocoa Crunch presents a pleasing contrast of favored flavors, and a real study in Crunch, though we imagine that your cereal won't stay in the bowl with milk long enough to get scientific with the exact crunch time numbers. We're looking forward to waking up to this sweet and crunchy breakfast treat, and enjoying Trader Joe's Organic Peanut Butter & Cocoa Crunch whenever that PB & C craving arises!

Why yes, dear readers, we are aware of both our geographical location and the date on the calendar. We also know that Summer Sausage really has nothing whatsoever to do with actual summer. It's more about not needing refrigeration until it's been opened. Trader Joe's Natural Summer Sausage begins with turkey raised on a vegetarian diet and without the use of antibiotics (ABF). It's not loaded with synthetic nitrites or nitrates (it is seasoned with celery powder, in which naturally occurring nitrates are present). It is loaded with flavor, thanks to the ample seasonings mixed in with the turkey. Cut into pieces and simmered with any number of sauces (try barbecue, curry, or sweet chili), it makes an excel- lent appetizer for an open-house gathering. Slice it and serve with your holiday cheese tray. It can be enjoyed hot, cold, or at room temperature-talk about versatile! We're selling each eight ounce Natural Turkey Summer Sausage for $3.99-talk about value! You'll find it in our refrigerated case.

These snack-sized Salame Sticks, are produced in Pennsylvania at Citterio's U.S. facility. Citterio, in Milan, Italy developed this recipe. This company has produced outstanding-quality aged meats since 1878, when Gi- useppe Citterio founded the salumeria. Short and slim Sticks are made from whole-muscle pork. The premium meat is flavored with a special blend of savory spices and hint of smoke, imparted during the unique drying process. The result is a satisfyingly chewy, meaty-tasting snack.

'It's Irre- sistible' Salame Sticks are ready-made for lunch boxes.

For Scotland, it's whisky. And for salami, Parma is where it's at-especially when \"it\" is Trader Joe's Uncured Salame di Parma Mild Salami. Imported from Parma, Italy, this Uncured Salame is sliced and packaged in the U.S.A. to ensure the freshest product possible. But before it makes its way across the Atlantic, the pork is slowly aged in the air of the Italian Apennine Mountains, which creates an ideal climate for drying and aging meat. This results in a well-balanced, mild Salame, with subtle notes of spice and a clean, satisfyingly meaty flavor. And there are no nitrates or nitrites added, except for those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt. For an Italian snack trifecta, pair this Salame with a few other things Italy is known for: freshly sliced Parmigiano Reggiano [sku 46837] and a bottle of Chianti [sku 79457]. Its mild flavor makes it a must-have when putting together a cheese plate. Roll up a slice and slide it on a toothpick with Giardiniera Pickled Vegetables [sku 60532] for an easy, party-worthy appetizer. Because it's packed in an easy open tray and thinly sliced, this Salame must remain refrigerated until you're ready to enjoy. What are we known for here at Trader Joe's? Value. Which is why we're offering 4-ounce trays of Trader Joe's Uncured Salame di Parma Mild Salami for $4.99, a whole dollar less than you'll find elsewhere.

Trader Joe's Spicy Uncured Charcuterie Selection makes an ideal centerpiece for that special sandwich station, and can make your antipasto platter into something spectacular. The Charcuterie Selection includes three, traditional Italian meats-all with a spicy profile. First, there's the Spicy Coppa, consisting of pork shoulder that is fermented & dried 90 days and seasoned with sea salt, sugar, red pepper, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg & cloves. Second, there's the Spicy Sopressa. It's premium pork butt (thicker part of the pork shoulder), fermented & dried 60 days and seasoned with sea salt, sugar, red pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper & white pepper. Third is the Spicy Cooked Capocolla, which is cooked, then fermented & dried 15 days. It also has a \"hot\" profile, with seasonings that include sea salt, sugar, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, nutmeg & cloves. All three of these high-quality cuts are Uncured, meaning that no nitrates or nitrites have been added, except those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt.

So named for the fact that its preparation involves the spinnning and separation (or, in Italian, mozzare, to cut or separate) of curds from liquid whey, mozzarella is available in all kinds of shapes and sizes, using all manner of different kinds of milks. Trader Joe's Part Skim Mozzarella, for instance, uses a portion of skim milk as its base, resulting in a slightly lighter and milder Mozzarella that's perfect for recipes where you want the flavor and texture of Mozzarella present, but don't want it to overwhelm the dish as a whole. True to its roots, our Part Skim Mozzarella makes a component in Italian cuisine, be it chopped into cubes for antipasti, sliced into medallions for caprese, or melted over a breaded chicken cutlet for chicken parmigiana. And while it's certainly lighter than our Whole Milk Mozzarella [sku 26985], it's still quite flavorful, so much so that it wouldn't be unreasonable to simply nibble on it on its own.

Within the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a \"brick.\" Brick, however, sounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not treated with rBST, it's everything you want cream cheese to be-rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread- able. So, rather than \"brick,\" we'd like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a \"block,\" as in \"building block,\" since it can be a building block in so many delicious dishes. What's that? You want examples? Sure. A simple appetizer idea: set it on a plate, top with salsa or sweet chili sauce and serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a Mexican or Thai inspired dip. How's that for instant versa- tility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips. Don't forget bagels-but how could you forget bagels? Pretzel Bagels [sku 52370], maybe? Perhaps our favorite usage for this particular building block is cheesecake. If you're up to the challenge of making a cheesecake from scratch, you won't find a better foundation.

Always full of fresh, mildly creamy flavor and a dense, firm, yet springy texture that has been pleasing international cheeseheads for centuries, Whole Milk Mozzarella is a delicately flavored cheese stalwart. As you may have guessed, Whole Milk Mozzarella starts with pasteurized whole milk coagulated with microbial rennet. When the whey is drained and the curds separated, things get stretchy and the process that makes Mozzarella the cheese that we know and love begins. It undergoes kneading of the fresh curd in hot water to give that famously springy, rubbery texture that it's known for. Our variety is low moisture meaning it has been dried out a bit longer than fresh mozzarella for longer shelf life and a slightly saltier taste. Excellently elastic with a tender mouthfeel, especially when melted. Like other pulled-curd cheeses, the flavor and texture is almost enjoyed even more when melted in a dish.

   "description": "With an unmatched selection of cut cheese, Trader Joe's has a cut for every corner of your cheese board, but sometimes pre-crumbled cheese is a clean and convenient way to cut a corner or two. Trader Joe's Crumbled Blue Cheese is here to help you elevate a dish with the complex flavors of blue cheese, but without feeling the blues when you're in the middle of crumbling up a moldy block by hand. Our Crumbles are the perfect size for adding to dips, dressings, and sauces or even sprinkling over a salad or freshly grilled summertime burger. Maybe you know, maybe you don't, but blue cheese gets its start like many regular cheeses with raw milk and an added microbial rennet, but then we take a hard left and thinks get a little funky. Blue cheese mold spores, Penicillium Roquefortii in this case, are added early in the process to allow them time to germinate, ample oxygen, and age along with the cheese to grow and release their flavors in the form of blue veins throughout the cheese. Our Crumbled Blue Cheese is aged for 60 days to allow the mold and cheese to release its famously sharp blue cheese flavors and aroma. Here is where we take care of that crumbling bit by breaking up the blue cheese block and portioning it into a handy, little resealable tub for you to enjoy as you please! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy just southwest of Milan, the Mascarpone story begins. While we got plenty of positives from Italy during the Renaissance, this fresh, cream cheese offering may be one of the best thing that came out of the turn from 16th to 17th century. Unlike many of the other cheeses you'll find in our refrigerators, Mascarpone is a pasteurized milk and cream cheese that is coagulated from the use of an acidic substances (in this case we use citric acid, but historically lemon juice and vinegar have been used). After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick crème fraîche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+. The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to both sweet and savory dishes. Mascarpone is used in tons of northern Italian dishes and desserts because the original flavor goes well with anything from mustard and spices to sweet cocoa and coffee. Grab a tub today and take your culinary travels to Italy with a Mascarpone recipe! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Mascarpone",

So naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to carry their Flagship Cheese-a semi-hard cheese made with a proprietary blend of Swiss and Cheddar cheese cultures-in our Pacific Northwest, Mid- Atlantic, and New England stores. Beecher's Flagship Handmade Cheese starts with the milk of Holstein and Jersey Cows, collected from local (local to Beecher's Seattle & Manhattan cheese shops, that is), family-run dairy farms. Carefully trained cheese makers add a proprietary blend of Swiss and Cheddar cheese cultures, salt, and microbial enzymes, then the cheese is left to age for 15 months. The end result is a complex, nutty, robust, and semi-hard cheese with a slight crumble that, frankly, we can't get enough of. Enjoy piece of Beecher's Flagship atop a TJ's Some Enchanted Cracker [sku 94591], possibly with a smear of TJ's Fig Butter [sku 96478] and a handful of TJ's Rosemary Marcona Almonds [sku 90083] on the side. It's also delish in grilled cheese sandwiches, omelets, and homemade mac n' cheese. Plus, the price is right on this Flagship Cheese, so you can slice, shred, and cube to your heart's content without breaking the bank. We're selling hunks of Beecher's Flagship Handmade Cheese for $12.29/lb.-about two dollars per pound less than it sells for anywhere else, including in Beecher's own cheese shops.

   "description": "\"Ricotta\" is an old Italian word literally meaning \"recooked\" which is a tell-tale, practical naming, telling you exactly how this fluffy, sweet cheese is produced. Cheesemakers simply take the whey left from whipping up batches of other types of cheese, drizzle in whole milk, an acid of some sort (in our case, acetic acid), and begin cooking the whey mixture. This causes curds to coagulate, grow, and solidify. Finally, the curds are strained of the remaining whey and you're left with freshly made, fluffy, white Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese. The aforementioned process is the \"traditional\" way (or should we say whey) of making ricotta, and as we're never one to shy away from culinary tradition, Trader Joe's Ricotta Cheese follows this authentic tradition to bring our shoppers a classically Italian cheese able to find its way into tons of recipes! An ideal cheese for lasagna, baked pastas, stuffed shells, and of course dessert recipes such as cannolis and cheese blintzes. In addition to all these mealtime options, our Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese is high in calcium and, for a cheese, light in fat and high in protein. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Glad you asked. Inside the tub is a blend of real pumpkin and an especially rich, tantalizingly tangy cream cheese, with a bit of vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon & ginger added to ramp up the \"pumpkin pie\" quotient. It's lightly whipped, so it's easily spreadable, yet it still retains the rich, dense texture of good cream cheese. Like any cream cheese worthy of the mantle \"schmear,\" our Pumpkin Cream Cheese is excellent on bagels, English muffins, or toast. It also makes an excellent dip for cookies (especially our Speculoos Cookies, and Pumpkin Biscotti), a natural mate for pumpkin bread and an imaginative alternative to peanut butter on a sandwich or in celery ribs.

The region's cool, moist climate makes it ideal for dairy farming and, thus, ideal for cheese making, too. Think about it: quality cheese requires quality milk, quality milk comes from healthy cows, healthy cows love nutritious grass, grass loves rain, and rain loves the Tillamook Valley! Phew. Tillamook® Medium Cheddar is made following the very same, four-ingredient recipe that Tillamook® has been following since 1894, when it was first introduced by a guy known as \"The Cheese King of the Coast.\" (Promising nickname, no?) The original-recipe Tillamook® Medium Cheddar, however, isn't kosher-so several decades later, the folks at Tillamook® launched a vegetarian-friendly, taste-alike version: Tillamook® Kosher Medium Cheddar. It's the same, rich and creamy Cheddar-aged for a minimum of sixty days to give it that signature, medium bite-but it's made under rabbinical guidance from OK Kosher, with vegetable enzymes instead of animal rennet. Tillamook® Kosher Medium Cheddar is the perfect \"universal\" Cheddar. Enjoy it with crackers. Use it in a grilled cheese sandwich. Shred it and host a Tillamook® Taco Tuesday. Slice it and let it melt atop a warm slice of TJ's Apple Crumble Pie [sku 61482].

These are perfect for the cheese lover that wants to avoid lactose... unless they are allergic to soy, which is among the top eight aller- gens. If you crave cheese, but you want to avoid lactose-and you are allergic to soy-we've got an announce- ment: Trader Joe's Almond Mozzarella Style Shreds Cheese Alternative is here for you! This is one of those products resulting from customer requests. You talked, we listened. If Almond Cheese seems a weird concept, just think about how common Almondmilk [sku 94740] has become in recent years. This Almond Mozzarella Style Cheese starts in a similar way-by adding filtered water to crushed, raw, non- irradiated, organic, California almonds. (Tiny flecks of brown almond skin in this cheese assure you that we are using whole, real almonds and not some synthetic, almond-ish alternative.) This almond milk forms the cheese base, to which is added casein (milk protein that coagulates to form curds), along with natural Parmesan cheese flavor. Obviously, this is not a vegan cheese, however it is 99% lactose free, which is great news for those who are lactose intolerant. Maybe the best news of all is the fact that our Almond Mozzarella Style Shreds possess a wonderful nuttiness and a great texture that melts like real cheese.

   "description": "The lush, green pastures of New Zealand's organic dairy farms provide the jumping off point for our Sliced New Zealand Organic Cheddar. The milk used to produce this distinctive cheese comes from cows raised on family owned dairies and treated to a diet of the abundant organic clover and grasses that blanket the pastures of New Zealand's dairy lands. Moderate temperatures (60-75ºF), flowing mountain streams, and abundant rainfall mean that there is ample pasture for grazing year round. Because of their diet, the cows produce incredibly rich and flavorful milk, and that milk, in turn, produces incredibly rich and flavorful cheese. Trader Joe's Sliced New Zealand Organic Cheddar is aged for three to six months, enough time to al- low its fresh and creamy profile to fully emerge. It's excellent on burgers, as a quick snack, and of course, on sandwiches, cold or hot - try it on a grilled cheese with arugula and fig butter! We're selling an eight ounce package of about eight slices for $4.99, every day. That's a cheesy value! You'll find it in our cheese case. 01.23. 17",

That product was Chèvre with Honey. To this day it's a Trader Joe's cheese case staple. We've decided, though, to give it a bit of a makeover¿ Trader Joe's Chèvre with Honey Goat's Milk Cheese is the same fantastic cheese we've been selling for ten years, but now in a five-ounce log with an updated label. Crafted using traditional techniques and goat's milk from small family farms in the Midwest, this Chèvre combines the sweet goodness of honey with the tangy temptation of goat cheese. One of the reasons for the enormous popularity of this cheese is not just its deliciousness or uniqueness, but also its versatility. You can enjoy it in the same way we did when we first encountered this product years ago: slathered thick on slices of crusty Organic French Baguette [sku 53835] and popped under the broiler for a couple minutes. Trust us, it's an instant crowd-pleaser. It's equally as wonderful when served with crackers and fruit, or spread on a piece of toast with Raspberry Preserves [sku 87805] in the early a.m. Atop a burger, intrigu- ing in an omelet, crumbled onto a salad, whipped up for a dessert¿ We're selling these slightly smaller five-ounce logs of Trader Joe's Chèvre with Honey Goat's Milk Cheese for $2.99 each, every day. 04.02. 18",

We've carried a fat-free version of this classic cheese for quite some time, but as palates and preferences are wont to change when it comes to food trends, we felt the existing product could use a refresh of sorts. Without further adieu, we're pleased to welcome Trader Joe's Part Skim Ricotta Cheese to our cheese case. To find a Part Skim Ricotta Cheese aligned with Trader Joe's standards (tastes excellent, offers amazing value, and made with milk from cows not treated with rBST), our product developer went to Wisconsin, a state that's second to none when it comes to cheesemaking capability. The cheese monger combines pasteurized whey, cream, milk, vinegar and a touch of salt to produce a cheese that's rich, creamy and slightly grainy in texture, with a fresh, slightly sweet flavor. What's more, a one-quarter cup serving of this rich, creamy, kosher (dairy) goodness has just 70 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein! The clean, versatile flavor of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese leaves it open to all sorts of culinary interpretation. Enjoy it with a few cracks of salt & pepper, olive oil and chopped fresh herbs. Bake it into a rigatoni casserole with spicy sausage and marinara.

So, while Cheddar is made around the world, people still think of England when they think of Cheddar. Same with Brie and France, as well as Parmesan and Italy. This place-name association extends to New World cheeses as well, like Monterey Jack (Monterey, CA) and Colby (Colby, WI). You could say, then, that by combining the latter two cheeses into a single Snack Stick, Trader Joe's has introduced a cheese that will forever be construed as a true American original. In this case, the country of origin matches this place-name connotaion - the Sticks are crafted for us in the home of Cheese Heads, Packers, and Badgers... Wisconsin.

Based on the continued success of crumbled cheeses in our stores, our Product Developer was happy to oblige customer requests, while at the same time creating a first-of-its-kind product (on our cheese shelves, at least). Please welcome Trader Joe's Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese! While traditional feta is made with sheep's milk, our Organic Crumbled Feta is made in Wisconsin with organic, rBST-free cow's milk. The cow's milk offers a milder flavor than sheep's milk, while retaining the pleasant tanginess so favored by feta fans. The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as \"pickling\" but with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates! Although a handful of Crumbled Feta atop a crisp romaine salad is a wonderful thing, there's an endless number of ways to enjoy its salty goodness outside of leafy greens. Stir it into rigatoni with sausage, white beans, and kale. Mix it with TJ's Fresh Bruschetta Sauce [sku 07904] and Steamed Lentils [sku 90240] for a quick cracker dip. Or, gently warm some Giant Chalkidiki Olives [sku 57608] in olive oil with chili flakes and lemon peel, then pour the mixture over a shallow bowl of Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese, and serve with crusty bread for dipping.

Indeed, it's hard to beat a piece of perfectly ripened, mildly nutty, sharp Cheddar cheese, but it's not always easy to keep a source of sharp Cheddar handy. That's where Trader Joe's Sharp Cheddar Cheese Snack Pack comes in: ten individually- wrapped, precisely-portioned slices of white Vermont Cheddar that work wonders for lunches, midday snacks, or anytime sharp Cheddar cravings. Vermont Cheddar - recognizable from its trademark white hue, the result of Vermont cheesemakers eschewing the use of anatto to color their Cheddars - is famous for its sharpness, and the Vermont Cheddar used in this Snack Pack is no exception. In addition to being delightfully sharp and flavorful, each .75-ounce slice of Cheddar is pleasantly smooth and slightly creamy in texture, providing an elevated eating experience you wouldn't normally find in a pre-sliced cheese snack. Combine that with the fact that each slice comes pre- wrapped and ready to move, be it in your lunchbox, briefcase, or carry-on, and you'll find that these Snack Packs are sharp in more ways than one. Easy to transport and easy to enjoy, you could call Trader Joe's Sharp Cheddar Cheese Snack Packs the cutting edge of convenience.

Can you even imagine a crispy spanakopita sans creamy feta? Wouldn't falafel feel awfully lonely without a few feta crumbles? Wouldn't a feta-less Greek salad be reduced to a salad without a country? Luckily, we don't have to deal in such alarming hypotheticals, because we've got Trader Joe's Israeli Feta at the ready. Since feta has such a long and storied history (records show that feta and feta-like cheeses have been eaten in the Mediterranean region for thousands of years, and even garnered a mention in Homer's Odyssey), we knew we needed a supplier who would respect that history. That's why we reached out to a 4th generation cheesemaker in Israel, whose family has been in the dairy business for over a century. Their feta speaks for itself: creamy, crumbly, and toothsome, with a wonderfully soft texture and a mild, tart tang - exactly how a feta ought to be. While we recommend using this Israeli Feta in all the ways you normally would for a delicious Mediterranean fetas, we also strongly encourage you to enjoy it as a table cheese or part of a cheese plate. A feta of this quality, with its subtle acidity and fine brininess, deserves to be savored, esepcailly with a glass of crisp or off-dry white wine. In addition to its synonymity with all things Mediterranean, you can also consider Trader Joe's Israeli Feta to be synonymous with value: we're selling each 8.8-ounce piece for the remarkably reasonable price of $5.99.

Often referred to as \"Mexican-style Parmesan cheese,\" Cotija [say: ko-TEE-ha] is a crumbly, white cheese made with fresh whole milk and aged for several months. And, yes, it does taste similar to Parmesan-but it's milder, saltier, and a bit moister. It's a practical, versatile cheese, and while it's certainly not limited to Mexican-inspired applications, it really is fantastic crumbled atop tacos, sopes, chilaquiles, nachos, etc. We also highly recommend using it to make elote, a.k.a. Mexican-style street corn-just grill up a few ears of corn, slather them with butter (or a mixture of mayonnaise & crema), then sprinkle them with TJ's Chili Lime Seasoning [sku 56662] and plenty of grated Cotija. ¡Qué rico! Like we said, though, this Cheese is a great value and won't cost you much cheddar-we're selling each 8-ounce wedge of Nuestro Queso® Cotija for $3.69, every day. De nada. 09.24. 18",

   "description": "Cashews have been doing some amazing things for non-dairy cheese alternatives, lately. In what can only be described as acts of remarkable faux-fromage ingenuity, we've seen this humble nut transform into all kinds of cheese-like snacks, including our nacho-esque Cashew Fiesta Dip [sku 61494]. Today, we're proud to announce yet another bold leap of progress for the cashew/dairy-free alliance, Trader Joe's Dairy Free Cheddar Style Slices, a handy pack of ready-to-go slices of vegan cultured cashew \"cheese\" that tastes, feels, and melts just like a slice of regular old Cheddar. How, you ask? Our supplier puts this cashew cheese alternative through a culturating and aging process inspired by traditional cheesemaking techniques. This not only gives each Slice a moderately sharp, Cheddar-like flavor, but mellows its texture to a degree where it melts nice and evenly. Which can only mean one thing: the dream of a satisfyingly melty vegan grilled cheese is now a reality! Trader Joe's Dairy Free Cheddar Style Slices, proudly made from cashews, are just the thing for topping vegan burgers (Protein Patty [sku 65240], anyone?), making dairy-free omelets, or even simply snacking on. We're selling seven ounce packs, each containing nine Slices, for $3.99*. Look for them in our cheese case. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Dairy Free Cheddar Style Slices",

Just to be clear, this is not to say that the extraordinary effect this cheese has on one's taste buds has diminished in any sort of way! On the contrary, the smooth creaminess of finely crafted American Cheddar is still fused with the tangy, crumbly texture of a hard, aged Italian cheese¿ and it's still surprisingly satisfying for the cheese-lover. Knowing the popularity of this cheese and knowing that our Customers are always looking for more ways to enjoy it, we've made the bold (and perhaps unexpected!) move to offer it in handy, Shredded form. This eight- ounce package contains large shreds of Unexpected Cheddar (an ounce more than the cut pieces we sell), ready for topping salads, soups, and open-faced sandwiches. This delicious cheese also works well in (and is now more easily added to) quesadillas, chili, sauces-whatever meal might require the complement of this classic Trader Joe's cheese. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

It starts with Wisconsin cheese made in the Toscano tradition by a fourth-generation, Italian-family-owned company. Then, inspired by all the shake-able extras you'd find at a pizza parlor (crushed red pepper, dried oregano, dehydrated garlic, etc.), wheels of carefully aged, creamy Toscano are hand-rubbed with a one-of-a- kind blend of dried herbs, spices & sea salt. The result? A Shredded Seasoned Cheese that lends pizza pizzazz to anything you sprinkle it on-pastas, potatoes, actual pizzas, burgers, salads, and so much more.

Not only is this a better name, it really does describe the eating experience of this product! We sampled lots and lots of dairy-free \"cheeses\" and finally settled on this one from a California-based supplier. They start with a crushed-cashew and water base and fortify it with coconut oil, and potato & corn starches. Sea salt and yeast extract add to the \"cheesy\" flavor, but it's really the curing of the cashew base over several weeks (a process not too unlike the culturing of real cheese) that gives these Shreds their authentic Mozzarella-Style flavor. In fact, we think this is such a good cheese alternative, you'll find the seven-ounce, re-sealable bag of Trader Joe's Mozzarella Style Shreds hanging in our refrigerators every day, right next to our other shredded cheeses! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Halloumi is certainly not the only cultural or culinary export of Cyprus, but it's definitely one of our favorites. This remarkably unique cheese would be notable for its taste and texture alone, which sit at a curious crossroads between mozzarella and feta. But of course, Halloumi goes the extra mile by having the deliciously unusual trait of browning, rather than melting, when grilled or heated in a pan. Don't get us wrong - melted cheese is undoubtedly wonderful, but there's something about a slice of warm, freshly grilled Halloumi, striped with gloriously caramelized grill marks, that keeps up coming back for more. That's precisely why we're bringing Atalanta® Halloumi Cheese, proudly labeled as \"The Cheese That Grills,\" to our cheese case. Like all Halloumi (or at least all Halloumi that can legally be labled as such), Atalanta® Halloumi is made on the island of Cyprus using sheep's milk. During production, the curds are heated to high temperatures, a process which gives it both its \"squeaky\" texture and ability to hold its shape when cooked or grilled. Atalanta®'s cheesemakers also include a bit of mint, which adds a slight refreshing counterbalance to Halloumi's natural brininess. We recommend pairing a grilled slice of Atalanta® Halloumi with fresh watermelon and a chilled glass of Freeda Rosé [63104]. We also recommend acting quickly, as supplies are limited. While inventory lasts, you can find 8.8-ounce packages of Atalanta® Halloumi in your Trader Joe's cheese case for $5.99*. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Atalanta® Halloumi Cheese",

We can help you ensure you never find yourself in this predicament again, and also guarantee you never accidentally purchase only one type of cheese for your guests (can you say faux pas?). How can we accomplish such great feats in a single cheese? Well, we can't. But we can with Trader Joe's Cheese Party Tray. Neatly wrapped inside each Party Tray are artfully arranged slices of four of our favorite cheeses: Colby Jack, Swiss, Mild Cheddar, and Pepper Jack. Your mission, should you choose to accept it: unwrap that package and put those slices to work! Having a barbecue? Let your guests choose which cheese shall adorn their burger. Making sandwiches for a crowd? Make that Turkey & Swiss and the Ham & Cheddar without having to open multiple packages of cheese. Want to up your grilled cheese game? Make a melt with all four cheeses on the same sandwich! (Talk about turning it up to 11!) How you employ the Cheese Party Tray is entirely up to you. The value is entirely up to us, and we say big value. That translates to $5.49 for each 16 ounce Tray, every day, in our cheese case. What time is it? Cheese Party time! 04.09. 18",

Aside from being a boon to bagels, cream cheese is essential in a wide variety of baked goods, soups, sauces, and so much more-which it makes it all the more challenging to work with if you have a lactose-free diet. That's where Trader Joe's Lactose Free Cream Cheese comes in. Made with lactase, the enzyme that naturally breaks down lactose, it has all the same delicately tart flavor and superb spreadability you'd expect from a Cream Cheese, and absolutely none of the lactose. Just like its lactose-containing cousins, Trader Joe's Lactose Free Cream Cheese can be used in a plethora of rich, delicious recipes, from fantastically full-flavored appetizer dips to consummately creamy chowders, to sweet and fluffy frostings for carrot cake, brownies, or homemade whoopie pies. It adds body and a nice depth of flavor when mixed into a baked macaroni and cheese or casserole, it makes for a marvelous Lactose Free cheesecake, and a spoonful will even elevate a simple pan of scrambled eggs. And, of course, it's also quite delicious as a topping for a bagel, especially when paired with a bit of our Wild Sockeye Smoked Salmon [sku 60442]. Lactose Free Cream Cheese",

   "description": "The Finger Lakes region of New York is well known for its wine production, and among its vineyards and wineries, a food-explorer can also find a good number of idyllic dairy farms that are producing some very fine cheeses. Trader Joe's Bucheron is one. This Soft Ripened Cheese is handmade with pasteurized milk from local goats. Lactic acid (instead of rennet) forms curds, yielding cheese with a smooth, delicate texture. The curds are first made into logs, which are eventually sliced into six-ounce rounds. The finished piece has a naturally white, pillowy rind. Its slightly salty, buttery interior has a clean taste, along with tangy aromas and faint hints of mushroom. This description could easily refer to a goat's milk brie-and that really is a good comparison for this bloomy, lactic, goat-cheese medallion. Also like brie, Trader Joe's Bucheron is best brought to room temperature and served with crackers or a baguette. It pairs well with fresh fruit, like apples and grapes-or dried fruit, like dates. And our Bucheron's creamy texture and full flavor incorporate well into full-fledged dishes, such as pastas, or salads.

The earliest records of Gouda trace back to the late 1200s, making it one of the oldest continuously made cheeses in the world. Fittingly enough, the supplier behind our newest sliced cheese is a Dutch creamery with a considerable history of its own. Over the course of six generations, the folks at Artikaas® have perfected the art of crafting full-flavored Gouda, including (and especially!) their sensationally savory Sliced Smoked Gouda. To make each package, the artisans at Artikaas® suffuse their Gouda with wood smoke (as opposed to smoke- flavored additives) for two hours before slicing and sending our way. This natural smoking process leaves each slice with a subtly smoky character that accentuates, rather than overpowers, the cheese's classically creamy flavor. Ideal for melting over a burger, layering into a grilled cheese, or folding into a chicken cutlet for a super flavorful cordon bleu, Artikaas® Sliced Smoked Gouda is a must-have for any cheese connoisseur, sandwich virtuoso, or appreciator of all things smoky.

Trader Joe's Sliced Sharp Cheddar is made for us under the supervision of two Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers, using milk from local family farms. It's a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored \"cheddaring\" process first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional cheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they've been cut and turned. It's a time and labor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more \"modern\" cheddaring methods like stirring the curds. The flavor and texture of Cheddar changes dramatically as it ages, to our eternal delight. Our Sliced Sharp Cheddar is aged four to six months, just enough time to develop its rich, creamy, nutty flavor and almost-but- not-quite-ready-to-crumble texture. This complexity makes it an ideal mate for a burger, and it's also excellent in cold sandwiches, panini, tuna melts, and omelets. Each slice is separated by parchment, making it easy to use and ideal for anytime at all. We're selling each 12 ounce package of 12 slices for $3.99, every day.

While anyone can make a similar cheese, it would legally have to be called \"white cheese\", and therefore not an authentically Grecian feta. While those separate specific areas may have minor differences in taste and texture, on the whole, feta is a curd cheese that has a salty taste and crumbly texture that is enhanced and moistened by a salty brine once in its packaging. However, this salinity can be partially removed if drained and rinsed with water from the packaged brine.

This cheese is multifunctional, but we admit it's absolutely best for sandwich making.

This Mozzarella is of course delicious cold, right out of the fridge, or melted. You can melt a Slice or two for turkey melts, atop chicken, or in 8 Mini Croissants [sku 65467] with Uncured Black Forest Ham [sku 86863]. Fold this cheese between corn or flour tortillas for a cheesy, quesadilla and top it with a dollop of sour cream and Mild Pico de Gallo Salsa [sku 93920]. Made with fresh, pasteurized part-skim milk and non-animal, microbial rennet (something vegetarians will appreciate), Trader Joe's Sliced Part Skim Mozzarella Cheese is again a great match between bread, including croissants and tortillas.

While you may find similar cheeses produced outside of Italy (and the EU) labeled \"Parmesan\", these are not the same as authentic Parmigiano Reggiano, which by law may only be made under strict regulations in the regions surrounding Parma and Reggio-Emilia in northern- central Italy. And that's exactly why we source Parmesan Reggiano that is produced by a century-old cheese company in the province of Parma. Raw (unpasteurized) cow's milk is curdled, drained, and packed into round molds reading for aging. The resulting \"wheels\" are then soaked in high-salinity brine for about 3 weeks, then aged to perfection. Finally, the Parmigiano Reggiano is grated into a convenient dusting to impart their famously piquant flavors to any dish you'd like at moments notice. Packaged in a resealable tub to keep the gratings fresh for next time.

Each \"brick\" has 50% less fat and 20% fewer calories thank regular cream cheeses.

How's that for instant versatility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips.

Unexpected indeed! Our cheese makers, based in Wisconsin, have origins in Valdastico, in Italy's mountainous, Northeastern Veneto region.

The goats bring us a bone-white cheese that is marinated in wine, called Cabra al Vino. Cabra al Vino is a semi-firm pasteurized goat's milk from Spain's Mediterranean coast. It is cured for 48-72 hours in Spanish red wine. The paste remains nearly pure white and the rind absorbs a lovely violet hue. The paste is sweet and smooth, delicately grapey, with a gentle, pliable texture and mild fruity flavor. Sheep's milk makes up the dominant cheeses in Spain, due to centuries of vast herds of sheep covering much of Spain. The most popular cheese is Manchego, produced in La Mancha. Manchego has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture with a distinctive flavour. It is well developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy. It is a classic flavor of Spain. Iberico is a blend of cows' sheep's and goats's milk which gives this cheese its smooth and complex flavor.

Try pairing it with fresh fruit like grapes and figs, dried fruit like Slab Apricots [sku 67325], or salty, savory fare like our Jumbo Pitted Greek Kalamata Olives [sku 25155]. Of course, since this is a Trader Joe's cheese we're talking about, in addition to being a delightfully spreadable Goat's Milk Creamy Cheese, it's also a delightfully good value: you can find 4.5-ounce tubs in our cheese section for the everyday price of $3.29*. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Whether you're enjoying poultry dishes inspired by the cuisines of India or China, or indulging in some Nashville Hot Chicken, spicy chicken is always in vogue. And the granddaddy of all the spicy chicken - at least here in the U.S. - is most definitely Buffalo style chicken, which first hit the scene (in Buffalo, NY... go figure) way back in 1964. Trader Joe's Buffalo Style Chicken Sausage is an homage to this classic flavor profile. Rather than tossing deep-fried chicken wings in a spicy sauce and serving them with a cheesy dressing, we've added the sauce to the sausage, and stuffed it with Cheddar and Monterey Jack Cheeses. these Sausages are super on the grill, served on a hot dog bun. They're also delish pan-fried and tossed with even more hot sauce, to really amplify those hot notes. We're offering them in one pound packages of five links for a limited time. They're in our fresh meat case. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Buffalo Style Chicken Sausage",

Of course, this commitment includes our fresh meat selection! We now have several fresh sausage offerings that not only cook up juicy and full of flavor, but that also possess some very attractive characteristics when it comes to how the meat is raised and processed. In the case of Trader Joe's Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage, for instance, our U.S. supplier uses chicken raised on all vegetarian feed, which have never been given antibiotics-ever. Aside from those estimable attributes, of course, they're also quite delicious: they're made in the style of a classic, Sweet Italian Sausage. Each link is seasoned with aromatic spices like mild anise and fennel seed, and contained in a natural pork casing to ensure a satisfyingly snappy texture once cooked through. They can be enjoyed simply on their own, as part of a delectably elevated hot dog, or incorporated into pasta dishes, sauces, soups, or even hearty breakfast hashes.

We offer an assortment of canned chili, including Beef Chili with Beans [sku 17186], Turkey Chili with Beans [sku 47936], and until recently, a meatless version called Organic Vegtarian Chili [sku 50846]. This vegetarian version was a best-seller... until our supplier was no longer able to produce it for us. Seeing this as an innovation opportunity, we replaced the textured soy protein of the original version with textured pea protein. In line with the latest vegetarian trends, this change maintains the 'meaty' texture of the original version, while also making Trader Joe's Organic Vegetarian Chili (now, in a green can) available to customers who are avoiding soy. Otherwise, the new iteration is similar to the previous recipe. It's still chock full of red beans and onions, with bell peppers, garlic, jalapeños, and seasonings that include chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and black pepper.

They start with a base of ground turkey, crushed tomatoes, and red beans, then season it all with diced green chile peppers and jalapeños, onions, and a suite of classic chili seasonings including garlic powder, cumin, and oregano. It all results in a superlatively hearty and satisfying home-style Chili that's equally excellent as an entrée or topping. Ready in mere minutes when heated in the microwave or on the stovetop, our Turkey Chili with Beans might be one of the easiest (and most cost-effective) options for a quick weekend lunch that you'll ever find on our grocery shelves. It can be enjoyed totally on its own, or accessorized with all sorts of condiments and toppings: we're particularly partial to a nice dollop of Sour Cream [sku 06223], some diced onions or sliced scallions, and, for those with a flair for the fiery, plenty of Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce [sku 74550]. Speaking of toppings, this Chili's chunky consistency and mix of meaty and tender textures also makes it great for ladling over hot dogs and hamburgers-you can even pair it with a Spicy Jalapeño Chicken Sausage [sku 28285] or Ground Turkey [sku 16574] patty if you want to keep things poultry-specific.

   "description": "The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called \"coffee triangle\" (Triángulo del Café), widely considered one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains¿ but this doesn't make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar. Trader Joe's Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix (natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix-a more typical number for other plantain growers. The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point-almost too soft to cut. Our Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly crisp. When your hand reaches into the bag, you'll pull out a handful of crunchy, gluten free \"chips\" with a sweetness all their own (absolutely no sugar is added). While they're a superb standalone snack, they also synergize spectacularly with all kinds of dips, but especially ones that have a bit of sweet and savory to them, like our Pineapple Salsa [sku 06602].

And while it has been knocked to third place (Carolina Reaper and Trinidad Moruga Scorpion in first and second, respec- tively), it still packs a ghostly punch. When something this spicy comes along, our first instinct is almost always how to eat it without injuring our- selves or others. And so we created Trader Joe's Ghost Chili Lattice Cut Potato Chips, of course. Ghost Pepper Potato Chips are seriously spicy chips, but if you're a lover of all things spicy, these will bring pure joy and bliss rather than pain and suffering. Their spiciness is also balanced by the naturally sweet profile of the potatoes themselves-the chili enhances, rather than overwhelms the potato. Crafted exclusively for Trader Joe's, these are lattice cut chips, so they really hold to their spicy seasoning. Hauntingly crispy, these treats evoke the spookiness of Halloween. In that spirit, by the time the goblins have disappeared from your neighborhoods, Ghost Pepper Lattice Cut Chips will have disappeared from your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

And if you'll allow us to toot our own horn for a moment, our new Restaurant Style White Corn Tortilla Chips really hit the mark. We start with fresh, white corn tortillas (yes, actual tortillas-we're working far and above the tortilla chip standard here, folks) that are cut into slightly larger, slightly thicker triangles and fried in vegetable oil until they're ultra-crispy. The frying process creates a durable crunch that stands up to the even the chunkiest of guacs and heartiest of nacho fixings. And it's not just their heartiness that makes our White Corn Tortilla Chips \"restaurant style\"-we also add a touch of sea salt and lime juice concentrate. ¡Qué auténtico!

The truffle's rarity, paired with its unique and coveted fla- vor, combine for an ingredient some have called \"the diamond of the kitchen.\" As one would expect such \"diamonds\" tend to stud gourmet cuisine-fancy pasta dishes and such. That's why for some people, our Organic White Truffle Potato Chips might, cause their own kerfuffle at first. Truffles? On Potato Chips? Yes, and again, yes. Our Chip makers take heritage varieties of organic potatoes, grown on family farms in Oregon and Washing- ton, and slice them thinly before cooking them to a crisp texture in a blend of organic oils. They add a simple yet sensational seasoning that includes Organic White Truffles from Italy (secret foraging location undisclosed) and Fleur du sel (sea salt) from western France, not-so-secretly found in the marshes of Guerande. The finished chip is ivory in color with black specks. It presents a heady aroma, familiar to truffle aficionados, and a delicate crunch that yields a light, earthy, umami-focused flavor. Snack on them one-by-one with a glass of cold Peak Organic IPA [sku 95856] by your side. Pile them on your grilled burger for extra umami and crunch.

Compared to similar snacks available elsewhere, these Chips are cut & rolled a little thicker for additional crunch.

Paired with this captivating crunchiness is a generous dusting of hot Chili & Lime Flavored seasoning. This makes for a tastefully tangy, definitely spicy profile-though we didn't get too silly with the chili, so you'll keep coming back to the bag for another handful. (We should also mention that the vibrant orange hue is naturally derived from vegetable juice, and paprika and turmeric extracts-another trait that sets this snack apart!)

Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk seasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works equally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips. Drawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch of a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous dusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and ginger extract. What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of spicy red chili pepper powder. As you snack, the spice builds steadily (but not altogether overwhelmingly) to an exhilarating crescendo of heat, making it a perfect treat for the real spice fans out there (you know who you are.) Indeed, Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips are big when it comes to spice, but they're actually quite modest when it comes to price: we're selling each six-ounce bag for $1.79, an especially great value when you consider that most other flavored plantain chips out there sell for $3 and up.

You may have heard of tostones, patacones, or tachinos, but if you're lucky enough to have tried them, then you know that they're delicious, crispy, and phenomenally savory, no matter what they're called. We drew inspiration from this curiously crunchy treat to create our newest snack creation. Feel free to call them what you like - we call them Trader Joe's Plantain Crisps.

   "description": "The true name for corn is maize, or in scientific nomenclature, Z. mays. Known to have been used as a staple food for Olmec, Maya, and Aztec cultures, food historians believe this originally wild plant was first cultivated on a broad scale in Mexico. We bow and give thanks to those early corn cultivators, for without them, our lives, quite sadly, would be lacking a current staple, Trader Joe's Unsalted Organic White Corn Tortilla Chips. These are triangle-shaped chips made with organic corn grown on farms in New Mexico and the Texas panhandle. They're cooked in organic vegetable oil, and like any good tortilla chip, these are ideal with any number of salsas and dips, especially guacamole. Don't, however, let tradition hem you in here. Dip these wedges in hummus, tapenades, or yogurt-based dips. Go even further in your maizeperimentation and use the Chips as carriers for chicken salad. Allow these Unsalted Organic White Corn Tortilla Chips to be the keys to your chipdom. Parties, picnics, beach days, work days, every day¿ there's always an occasion that calls for Tortilla Chips, so it's good to always have a bag on hand. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "There was a time, in the not-so-distant past (yet sometimes it feels like a lifetime ago), that we sold quite a number of potato chips in bags bearing national brand names. Whatever were we thinking? In fact, at one stage, we offered two entirely different rippled, ridge cut potato chips with the same flavor profile. Why would we do such a thing? Well, we remedied that situation by doing what we do-we held a blind tasting to determine which was best, and the winner got a packaging facelift. Actually, the winner got a packaging face transplant-it won its way into the world of Trader Joe's private label, and has been winning fans ever since. Trader Joe's Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt were the winners then, and they remain winners today. They're thick slices of Arizona and Minnesota grown potatoes, cooked in small batches in expeller pressed sunflower oil, then lightly salted. They're simple chips, with three simple ingredients, and they're simply delicious. On their own, dipped in virtually any dip, or even crushed and used as a breading for chicken (trust us here: yum!), these Chips are the real deal. One of the benefits of the Trader Joe's label versus a national brand label is we're able to negotiate better pricing when we package products in our label. That holds true here. Have you shopped for chips elsewhere? They're crazy expensive! But ours aren't. We're selling Trader Joe's Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt in a 16-ounce bag for $2.99, every day. That's a value that's a chip off the old Joe.",

In other words, these Blue Chips have earned their blue chip reputation. Our supplier scours the stalk market for the finest organic, stoneground blue corn that money can buy, then adds a bit of water to it to make masa (dough). Once the masa is rolled flat and machine-cut into uniform triangles, the chips take not one, not two, but three passes through an open-flame conveyer oven. After a quick dip in the fryer and a few rolls through a giant salt tumbler, these chips are crisped & ready for whatever fixins they're asked to face-from heaps of chunky salsa, to bowls of creamy guac, to piles of melt-y cheese, and beyond! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

While you normally eat bananas raw, plantains are almost always cooked before eating to take the more firm, harder edge off of the fruit. Where bananas are sweet, plantains are on the starchy side and though plantains are technically a fruit, they're commonly eaten like root vegetables. When you think of them this way, Trader Joe's Plantain Chips make perfect sense to be added to our collection of snackable chips. Our Plantain Chips come from Peru, where the plantains are picked when they're just ripe enough to be slightly sweet. They're sliced and cooked in sunflower oil, then dusted with salt. They eat like sort-of-sweet, thick-cut potato chips, but with half the fat of typical potato chips.

   "description": "Though nuttily named, the coconut is technically a drupe (or \"stone fruit\"), not a nut. It is widely believed that the coconut originated in the islands of the south Pacific, but pinpointing the exact location has been difficult, as it's a fruit that has the uncanny ability to travel on its own. That's right; the coconut floats. This means that it likely dropped from palms on one island and traveled unaccompanied to neighboring islands, over and over again, growing wild on every island it visited along its travels. Fifteenth century Portuguese explorers gave it its name, and the coconut, in every imaginable form, has been enjoyed around the world ever since. Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips present coconut in a simple, delicious, snack and recipe- ready form. Our supplier in Sri Lanka harvests the mature organic coconuts, then cracks, slices, and dries the coconut. They add nothing during this process other than time and care. The result is a coconut chip that's ideal for all of those recipes (we're talking to you, Pinterest!) calling for unsweetened coconut. Don't get us wrong; this is sweet coconut¿ naturally sweet, without any of the added sugars found in sweetened coconut chips/shreds. Inside each bag of Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips you'll find a single ingredient-organic coconut. Use the Chips for baking and cooking, add them to home-blended trail mixes (they're especially good paired with our Candy Coated Milk Chocolate Drops [sku 56854]), use them to top salads, or snack on them by the handful, right out of the bag. They're crunchy and captivatingly coconutty. We're selling each eight ounce resealable bag of Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips for $1.99.

   "description": "When it comes to brewing, what's the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat, don't pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible and, some would argue, more enjoyable. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth. Cold brewing is hot. While we're pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration can take somewhere between 12-24 hours. Don't know about you, but our cup of coffee can't always wait, so; we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in Texas, we start with a half a pound, medium roast, 100% Arabica beans from the world's finest growing regions. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered to create 32 ounces of delicious, naturally sweet, ready-to-pour Trader Joe's Cold Brewed Coffee Concentrate. That's equivalent to about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water, milk, etc. If you like it strong and steamy, mix it with a bit of hot water for a smooth cup. Or pour it over some ice for a cold cold brew. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it's ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bitterness, it's even great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream. We're selling each 32 ounce container of Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate for $7.99, which is equal to about 66¢ a cup! Serving Suggestion",

   "description": "Some denounce the practice of flavoring coffee, saying that it's mostly a ruse to make bad beans taste better. Apparently, it is true that some sellers take their aging inventory and mask the spoils with flavored oils. While this may be the case with some shady purveyors, be assured that Trader Joe's approaches every cup of Joe with excellence and integrity. And, our French Vanilla Coffee is certainly no exception! We start with 100% Arabica beans from Brazil. Our San Francisco roaster gives them a medium-dark roast for a cup that is full-bodied and rich. The beans are then ground and infused with a natural flavor oil that imparts fragrant and sweet-tasting vanilla notes. But, why call it \"French\"? It's about ice cream. The basic French recipe for vanilla ice cream includes egg yolks (not present in all vanilla ice creams). The addition of eggs yields a more custard-like result. Consequently, other foods with the same buttery, caramelly flavor profile and aroma are also dubbed \"French Vanilla.\" Of course, you'll find similar custard characteristics in Trader Joe's French Vanilla Coffee. Still wondering why we flavored this coffee-if not to mask bad beans? A single sip should wash your wonder away!

Since then, the bottled cold brew and cold brew concentrate trend has all but exploded, and ours is the best value on the market-by a long shot. So, when we approached our supplier about introducing a second variety of Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate this year-this time an organic offering-we were thrilled when they agreed. Like it's predecessor, Trader Joe's Organic French Roast Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate is smooth, lush, and low in acid. In fact, because cold brew coffee is never heated, the oils and acids that give coffee its infamous, bitter \"bite\" don't pass through the brew. The result is a cup of coffee that is almost sweet and contains more than 50% less acid than a hot-brewed cup. Unlike its predecessor, however, our new offering is made only from USDA Organic coffee beans-which our Texas-based supplier treats to a slightly darker, slightly bolder French roast. Combine one part Trader Joe's Organic French Roast Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate with two parts water, milk, or any liquid and serve over ice-and don't limit \"milk\" to dairy milk, because this stuff blends beautifully with your favorite TJ's non-dairy milk beverages, too. If iced coffee isn't your thing, you can always reconstitute this cold brew with hot water and skip the ice cubes. You'll still have one mighty-fine, smooth-drinking cup of coffee on your hands. Or in your hands. We've yet to see a 32 ounce bottle of organic cold brew coffee concentrate sell for anything less than $12-and most brands retail for closer to $14 a bottle. But we're not \"most brands,\" so we're selling each 32 ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Organic French Roast Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate for $9.99, every day-that's about 83¢ per 12-ounce cup of coffee you make with it.

Then, we grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness canister. This means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we still recommend ap- proximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water. If you already enjoy the whole bean version, and are looking for new ways to simplify your morning routine, switching to Joe's Dark Ground Coffee is an easy step in the right direction. And, it's easy on your budget, too, since it comes in the same size canister as the whole bean-version, for exactly the same price. That's $4.99 for 13 ounces. 03.28. 16",

So much so, that our \"pre-coffee\" personas can be sorely lacking-not only in personality, but also in the hand-eye coordination and basic math skills it takes to grind, measure, scoop, and pour. It's a bit of a Catch-22, really... we need the coffee to help us make the coffee, but we can't drink the coffee until we make it. Not to worry. We can help you with this one: Fair Trade Organic Co- lombian Coffee Cups to the rescue! Unlike our other single serve coffee offerings, you cannot find this Colombian Coffee's counterpart with our other whole bean coffees. It's uniquely available as twelve, single-serving cups for use with your Keurig K-Cup® coffee maker! Made with 100% Arabica beans, this coffee is medium roast, fair trade, and organic. The ripe cherries are picked by hand and sun-dried to produce a mild, well-balanced cup of coffee. Each individual cup- package is nitrogen flushed and sealed for freshness. Our unique mesh system allows you to see and smell your coffee, the moment that seal is opened. One \"cup\" yields one regular serving of hot coffee. It's easy. It's fast. It's 100% recyclable. And, the taste? C'est magnifique! You get twelve cups of coffee for $4.99. If our calculations are correct, that's just $0.41 per cup. Find a café, or even a diner, with that price! Even if you do, you'll still be missing the medium body, the rich ebony color, and the sweet-pungent, smoky aroma of Trader Joe's Fair Trade Organic Colombian Coffee Cups.

Expanding our offerings in the pre-measured, machine-brew arena, we're now selling capsules made for use in Nespresso® Original Line coffee makers.* Trader Joe's Ristretto Espresso Capsules contain a custom blend of Arabica & Robusta coffees selected from Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, and Vietnam-and, in case you're wondering, this is no willy-nilly selection of beans. The Brazilian Arabica, for instance, helps deliver excellent body with roasted, nutty-sweetness. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese Robusta beans bring a real punch to the finish. In general, this the whole blend packs a \"punch\" true to its Italian name. (Ristretto literally means \"restricted,\" referring to the exceptionally strong, concentrated nature of this coffee.) Brewing yields a small cup of deep, dark-brown coffee with a golden crema cap. The aroma is clean, bright and strong. The flavor is full bodied and intense with low acidity, and subtle fruity-nutty notes. If you have a Nespresso® machine, you're going to want to give Trader Joe's Ristretto Espresso Capsules a try- especially because this box of 10 single-serving Capsules is an incredible value, at $3.99.

   "description": "When it comes to brewing, what's the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat don't pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth. While we're pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration required for a proper cold brew can take some- where between 12-24 hours. Don't know about you, but our cup of coffee can't always wait, so we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in California, we start with the same medium roast, 100% Arabica bean base as our original Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate [sku 50759]. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered, then something special happens-natural coconut flavors are added to create a bold, smooth tasting, tropically-inspired brew-namely, Trader Joe's Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate. Mix one part Coconut Cold Brew Concentrate with two parts water or milk, and pour over ice for a lush, tropical hot weather treat. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coconut coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it's ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bit- terness, it's great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream. We're selling 16 fluid ounce bottles (enough for four-12 fluid ounce servings when reconstituted with water, milk, etc) of Trader Joe's Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate for $4.99.

As its name implies, cold brew coffee is brewed with cold water (rather than hot water), so some of the heat-activated oils and acids inherent in the coffee don't pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous, bitter bite, the nuanced flavors of the beans become strikingly more perceptible. With around 50% less acid than a hot water-brewed cup of coffee, cold brew is truly smooth, but the brewing process can be a hassle. Luckily, Trader Joe's Cold Brew Coffee Bags make crafting the perfect cold brew an absolute cinch. Picture giant tea bags - only instead of tea, they're filled with 100% Arabica medium-roast coffee, grown in Tanzania at the base Mt. Kilimanjaro. Simply toss two Bags into a pitcher with 7 cups of cold water, let it steep in the fridge overnight (8-12 hours), and say good morning to a bright, smooth glass of Cold Brew, complete with subtle, complex notes of berries and molasses! We're selling each 8.5-ounce resealable bag of four Cold Brew Coffee Bags for $5.99. Two Bags yield seven 8-fl. oz cups of Cold Brew, so if you do the math, that's about 43¢ per ice-cold, refreshing cup! Quite a bargain when you consider that an 8-ounce cup of identically-brewed Cold Brew will set you back at least $2.50 at your local coffee joint.

There are also times when you want a cup of coffee that's a little more on the mellow side, with strong coffee flavor but without the intensity you get from some brews. Trader Joe's Organic Breakfast Blend is the coffee for those occasions. You may have noticed a new look for our Organic Breakfast Blend-rather than a canister, it now comes in a valved bag. In addition to being a more efficient form of packaging, the bag also helps protect your coffee, too: when coffee beans are roasted, they emit a small amount of CO2, and can continue to do so even after being sealed in packaging. This valve lets that CO2 escape, without letting any oxygen in, ensuring that your coffee stays fresh and that the bag doesn't inflate. Ingenious! Other than its new packaging, it's still the same great coffee, still sourced for us from a series of small coffee cooperatives across Latin America, including Southern Mexico, Guatemala, and the Peruvian Andes. Organic, kosher, and fair trade certified, it's a beautifully balanced Blend that's been toasted to a medium roast to create a smooth, mellow, super-drinkable flavor profile. We find that makes it the ideal brew with which to start your day-which is why we call it Breakfast Blend.

Brought to us by a new supplier, whose increased efficiencies (including the change to a bag, rather than a canister) allow us to offer this rich, super dark-roasted whole bean coffee for a signifcantly lower retail, our new French Roast is nothing if not buzz-worthy. It's made with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Peru and Brazil, which, when made into drip, pour-over, or even cold brew coffee, creates a rich, robust cup with notes of cacao, baking spice, and toasted pecans. So, what precisely makes a coffee blend with Peruvian and Brazilian beans a French Roast? The \"French\" actually refers to the level of roast, rather than its geographical provenance. While food historians aren't entirely certain when and where the term originated, it's very likely a reference to the fact that, in the 19th century, super dark-roasted coffee was all the rage in French cafés. One sip of our French Roast, and it's easy to see why: in addition to imparting a deep, dark hue to the beans, the extra roasting time also intensifies its sweet, chocolatey aromatics, and heightens the nuttiness and spice on the palate.

Semi-sweet, toasty, and marked with notes of cacao, our Java of the Gods has a substantial mouthfeel and dark, chocolatey profile that's ideal for serving with decadent desserts and all sorts of breakfast dishes, savory and sweet. When paired with a stack of syrupy Belgian Waffles [sku 96967] or toasted, buttered Pancake Bread [sku 63303], for instance, its relatively low acidity and semi-bitter edges (resulting from this Java's deep, dark roast) will cut through the sweetness, providing a captivating complement. When served alongside a savory omelette, breakfast sandwich, or plate of spicy chilaquiles, however, those same qualities will allow the stronger flavors from both the coffee and the food to intermingle and reinforce one another. However you pair this Java of the Gods, or even if you just plan to sip it solo, be sure to pick up a bag before too long, because supplies are decidedly limited. Java of the Gods Small Lot Coffee",

   "description": "It turns out that a long drive, a closed truck, and hot weather are the perfect combination for a truly special brew. Enter Trader Joe's Tropical Bahia Brazil Small Lot Coffee! After harvesting, coffee beans need hot, arid weather to thoroughly dry before roasting. The high growing regions of Bahia, Brazil aren't blessed with such conditions, so growers send their beans away to sunnier regions-this journey is where the Tropical Bahia Brazil magic happens. Ripe Arabica coffee beans spend the long drive in a hot, closed truck. These conditions set off a fermentation process that, unlike the controlled and monitored process for most coffee, happens naturally and with minimal interference. Such spontaneity gives Tropical Bahia Brazil its unique character. A medium roast results in a balanced coffee that boasts layered flavors, notes of sweet fruits, and a touch of acidity. Once in our hands, the beans are packed in bags with one-way valves that keep oxygen out-this helps to preserve their singular flavor. Brew hot for an interesting morning cup, pair with fruit pastries like Raspberry Croissant Carré [sku 77043] and Strawberry & Rhubarb Hand Pies [sku 74290], or enjoy over ice with a splash of milk (or a non-dairy alternative) for an afternoon pick-me-up. Tropical Bahia Brazil is part of our Small Lot Coffee program, which means quantities are truly small. Pick up a bag and brew a cup while it's on our shelves! Tropical Bahia Brazil Small Lot Coffee",

It is within the forests of the Kaffa region that arabica coffee was first found growing wild. This coffee has got it all - it's USDA organic, shade grown, and fair trade certified which supports fair sale prices given to farmers for the 100% arabica green beans they grow so well. And grown under a canopy of trees, our FTO Shade Grown Ethiopian Coffee is grown nestling itself amongst a diverse habitat in its natural setting as opposed to many modern, sun-tolerant coffee plants that are grown in direct sunlight. All of this comes together in harmony to receive its medium dark roasting to give a rich tasting, medium bodied coffee that takes on a slightly acidic tartness and floral aroma. The beans are then packaged immediately and the canister nitrogen flushed to help ensure the freshest beans are what you smell when you get home and peel back the freshness seal. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

And while it's nice to be able to revel in that ritual, the reality is that we can't always take the time to slowly brew a cup in quiet contemplation. Sometimes, we just need a cup of coffee, even when we don't have access to a coffee machine. For mornings and moments like that, we have Trader Joe's 100% Colombian Instant Coffee. Ever been curious how Instant Coffee is made? It's less complex than it seems: first, our supplier brews up a big batch of coffee using 100% Colombian coffee beans, then sprays a mist of that coffee into an environment that's been made super hot and super dry. By the time the mist settles onto the ground, the droplets dry into tiny crystals that can then be reconstituted into liquid coffee via the reintroduction of hot water. What that means for you is that each cup of our 100% Colombian Instant Coffee has all the earthiness and invigorating flavor of a pot of drip coffee - because that's precisely what it is! Pleasantly roasted, perfectly mild, and wildly convenient (especially for traveling), Trader Joe's 100% Colombian Instant Coffee is also a genuine everyday value: you can find 3.5-ounce jars at your local Trader Joe's for $3.99*. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. 100% Colombian Instant Coffee",

Wake Up Blend is a mix of organically grown, fair trade certified, 100% Arabica Beans from small-scale farms in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Peru. The farmers who grow the beans are committed to organic and sustainable agricultural practices. They're also committed to cultivating truly excellent coffee beans. Here, those high quality beans are given a medium roast that brings out their best flavors and results in a smooth, well-balanced cup with bright acidity and just a touch of inherent sweetness. We like waking up to the aroma and flavor of Trader Joe's Organic Fair Trade Wake Up Blend.

   "description": "Did you know? Both green and black tea are made with leaves that come from the same species of plant , Camellia sinensis. The difference in color and flavor between the two is due to the fact that black tea leaves undergo a withering (accelerated drying) and oxidation (curing in a climate-controlled room) process, whereas green tea leaves do not. Hence, green teas, like our Trader Joe's Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage, have a fresher, more floral, more delicately grassy flavor. And it's exactly that flavor profile that makes our pre-brewed, ready-to-drink Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage so remarkably refreshing. Equally delicious whether it's served hot or chilled, it can be customized with slices of your favorite citrus, muddled with a sprig of mint, or even incorporated into an alluringly aromatic cocktail. We find that its fine, earthy notes are particularly well suited for serving alongside savory pastries, fresh cut melon, and seafood of all kinds.

We wouldn't dream of attaching our name to just any old tea, though, so our Buyer searched high and low for the perfect fit-and she found it in our new unsweetened Golden Oolong Tea. Trader Joe's Golden Oolong Tea boasts a bright, golden flavor profile to match its bright, golden color-and its pleasantly floral finish leaves an almost sweet, slightly toasty taste on the tongue. Stronger than most green tea but more mild than black tea, oolong is known for being exceptionally drinkable. Part of its drinkability stems from how it's processed; oolong tea is made from tea leaves that have only been partially oxidized (ex- posed to oxygen) during processing, whereas black tea is made from leaves that have been left to fully oxidize. The result is so smooth that it shouldn't take you too oolong to down the whole bottle¿ We're selling each 16.9-ounce bottle of Golden Oolong Tea for $1.19, which is almost a whole dollar less than we've seen similar ready-to-drink oolong teas sold for elsewhere.

With all these options, we still noticed a gap-and it's one that Trader Joe's Ready to Drink Cold Brew Coffee fills to the rim. It comes in a large-format bottle (multiple servings), similar to our Concentrates. However, unlike the Concentrates, this bottle's contents require no dilution with water. More precisely, what you'll find inside is small-batch Cold Brew Coffee made using an authentic cold-brew process that includes 100% Arabica beans from Colombia that are air-roasted and ground, then steeped in cold water for at least 12 hours. What it doesn't include is any reconstituted coffee, additives, or preservatives. And, just as the cold-brew-coffee connoisseur would expect, the flavor here is bold & rich, with a smooth body, and significantly less acid than hot-brewed java. With that acid and bitterness out of the way, you can really catch the hints of molasses, and notes of walnut and cocoa offered in this premium brew.

Okay, so we don't technically know when and where the first cup of chai was brewed-but we do know that sometime in the late 19th century, Great Britain was pulling out all the stops in an effort to increase black tea consumption wide and far. Lucky for us, in India, these promotional efforts birthed the ultimate East-meets-West beverage: black tea brewed according to Indian tradition (with plenty of aromatic spices) and served according to British tradition (with plenty of milk and sugar). Hi, chai. Now, over a hundred years later in your neighborhood store, another chai hero is born: Trader Joe's Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai. Like the chai of yesteryear, our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai strikes the perfect balance between comfortingly sweet and pleasantly spicy. All the usual suspects are present (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, allspice, and black pepper), plus the addition of vanilla extract to tweak the flavor profile-but unlike the chai of yesteryear, this Chai is vegan and contains absolutely no dairy. Instead, the spices are softened by pea protein powder, almond paste, and coconut cream. And this beverage isn't just East-meets-West; boasting 16 grams of protein per bottle, it's also nutrition-meets-indulgence. Down a bottle of Trader Joe's Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai before or after a workout. Mix two parts Chai with one part TJ's Cold Brew Concentrate [sku 50759] for a protein-packed eye-opener.

The people behind Health¿Ade Kombucha take \"carefully crafted, health-conscious beverage\" and raise it to an even higher level, with their super-diligent approach to kombucha brewing. The husband/wife/best-friend trio from Los Angeles who started Health¿Ade decided early on they were com- mitted to producing \"the best tasting and highest quality kombucha you can buy.\" Their meticulous attention to detail and patient approach to brewing has paid off. Each small batch (only 2.5 gallons!) begins with organic black or green tea, organic evaporated cane juice, and a S.C.O.B.Y. (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast). This combination activates natural fermentation as the colony consumes the sugar, producing acids. Unlike other kombuchas, nothing else is added to hasten this fermentation process. As the Health¿Ade folks like to say, \"The brew tells us when she's ready.\" Additionally, the entire fermentation process takes place in glass-unlike other kombuchas that are exposed along the way to leaching from plastic or metal containers. Health¿Ade's Pink Lady Apple is flavored with the juice of cold-pressed Pink Lady apples, added to the fer- mented brew to create a \"crisp, elegant, and scrumptious,\" naturally effervescent beverage. It's never pasteurized (so as not to hinder the probiotics), and it's naturally low in caffeine, sugar, and calories. We're selling 16 fluid-ounce bottles of Health¿Ade Pink Lady Apple Kombucha for $3.99. That's about a dollar less than what you'll pay at other retailers.",

Yeah, that happened...) And when it comes to the intersection of food trends and \"wellness\" trends, forget about it; we've all seen some ridiculous stuff in that realm. (Just say \"no\" to the cabbage soup diet, people...) But every now and then, when the moon is blue & the stars align, we come across a product like our new Organic No Joke Ginger Juice Shots- a product that's trend-inspired, wellness-conscious, and-above all else-just plain good. It's also a testament to the fact that the quality & variety of our fresh juice offerings now rival what you'd find at a fresh juice shop... at a fraction of the price. These days, it seems like everybody is \"juicing.\" We certainly aren't doctors, so we can't (and won't) comment on any potential health benefits of this trend. We do, however, have some pretty well-trained taste buds, and from where they sit, it's safe to say that not all juices are created equal. In fact, some cold-pressed ginger juices & juice shots (particularly those sold at grocery & convenience stores) taste noticeably watered-down...because they are watered-down.

Because this isn't just any Latte-it's three shots of cold-pressed, expertly roasted Nizza espresso blended with milk, sweetened with cane sugar, and infused with food grade nitrous oxide via a pin-sized valve in the bottom of the can. The result is an ex- ceptionally silk, smooth, and rich latte complete with a frothy layer of foam, just like you'd find in a café. Enjoy a chilled Triple Draft Latte anytime you need a pick-me-up. Pour it over ice cream for an over-the-top affogato.

Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Green Juice is just as it should be. Each 15.2-ounce, 100-calorie bottle contains an impressive one whole pound of spinach and seventeen kale leaves.

In addition to providing loads of protein (and loads of energy), powerfully proteinous potables like our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai Protein Smoothie [sku 57011] also provide loads of flavor, which got us thinking: what other sensations could we summon in smoothie form? After sampling a few new combinatins, we ended up picking the best of the bunch: say hello to Trader Joe's Banana & Almond Butter Protein Smoothie Beverage. Made with a mix of coconut water, banana purée, almond butter, and pea protein, this Smoothie Beverage conjures the simple delight of a banana and almond butter sandwich (which we also heartily recommend) in the form of a smooth, creamy (but still decidedly non-dairy) beverage. Packed into each 16 fl. oz bottle are 14 grams of protein, courtesy of the miracle of pea protein, giving you what you need to fuel your workout, hike, or even just your day at the office. Of course, if you're looking to truly kickstart your morning, you can also mix your Smoothie with a bit of Cold Brew Concentrate [sku 50759] to really get things going. With all this protein, flavor, and almond-banana-coconut water synergy, you'd expect our Banana & Almond Butter Protein Smoothie Beverage to come with quite a price tag.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe's just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of GT's¿ Aqua Kefir. GT's¿ Aqua Kefir starts with tiny kefir \"grains,\" which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combintion of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \"grains\" are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment.

(Kombucha & \"regular\" kefir-the dairy kind-come from a similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) This all may sound dubious to the uninitiated, but GT's¿ Aqua Kefir is actually relatively mild compared to its vinegary cousins (kombucha, drinking vinegars, etc.), yet still loaded with probiotics. And the probiotics supply you, the Keeper of the Kefir, with a \"light tang\" instead.

In the spirit of the day, we positioned a mild, rather uninspiring product against an absurd aural backdrop-think: monster truck rally-style guitar riffs, an bewilderingly intense sales pitch, etc.-and the result was a hoot. (Such a hoot that we even turned it into a video several years later-go check it out on our YouTube channel!) Now, flash forward, to the present day, and guess what?

So when the folks over at Suja® offered us a great deal on a limited buy of their Organic Cold-Pressed Celery Juice, we leapt at the chance. [Insert scintillating electric guitar riff here.] As its name implies, Suja® Organic Cold-Pressed Celery Juice is USDA-certified organic and cold-pressed. It's light, it's bright, and it contains nothing but pure, organic celery juice blended with pure, organic lemon juice.

Luckily, we've got Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Watermelon Juice and its pure, crisp, straight-from-the-melon flavor to keep us refreshed all season long. To make each 12 fluid ounce bottle of this Cold Pressed Watermelon Juice, our supplier squeezes a pound and a half of pure watermelon and one fitfh of a lemon in a slow, steady hydraulic press, allowing every drop of juice to be extracted from the fruit. The juice is then bottled and subjected to a process called High Pressure Processing (or HPP), which keeps it fresh, flavorful and safe to drink, all without the use of added preservatives.

Every week we put out new items you can eat... so it makes sense that we would also provide an item meant to help maintain regularity and support gastrointestinal transit time.* Think of it as a hospitable gesture, sort of like offering your dinner guests a brandy after a hearty meal. (Maybe not exactly, but you get the gist.) With this hospitable goal in mind, we're now offering Whole Psyllium Husks from Now. This family owned company, founded in 1968, has the same mission today as it had at the beginning: Empowering people to lead healthier lives. Psyllium Husks are the dry outer covering of the seeds from an herbaceous plant also known as Plantago ovata. Found all over the world, these husks are hydroscopic, meaning they attract, absorb, and hold water molecules. When liquid is added, they bulk up significantly, yielding mucilage-a thick, gooey, soluble fiber produced by nearly all plants. Like Flax and Chia, Psyllium Husks are high in mucilage, meaning they are an excellent source of dietary fiber when used as a daily supplement. To use, vigorously mix up to two tablespoons of Husks into at least 12 ounces of water or juice and drink imme- diately. Follow up with plenty of additional fluids throughout the day. We're selling Now brand Psyllium Husks in a 12 ounce bottle for $6.99.

Some say collagen is beneficial to our health, and even our appearance. The human body, however, produces less and less collagen for itself as we age, so some folks turn to dietary supplements to support their joint health, skin health, and hair health. Which is precisely why we carry Trader Joe's Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder: made with pure, unflavored, powdered beef collagen, it's a consummately convenient way to introduce more collagen into your diet. Our supplier prepares each batch via a hydrolysis process that leaves the proteins so fine that they easily dissolve into all kinds of hot and cold drinks. Just add two scoops of Collagen Powder (using the scoop that's provided in each pouch, naturally) to your morning cold brew, afternoon smoothie, or evening cup of tea, then mix, and enjoy. Each serving provides 12 grams of collagen to your daily regimen, and is virtually odorless and flavorless, making it a great option for simply mixing into a glass of water. However you enjoy it, you're sure to enjoy our value: Trader Joe's Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder is three dollars less than the brand we previously offered on our shelves-for the same amount of product!

Right now at Trader Joe's we have a new sauce that's red hot-figuratively, that is. We're talking about Trader Joe's Green Dragon Hot Sauce, a deep-green colored sauce with heat, tang, a bit of sweet, and did we mention heat? Green Dragon Hot Sauce shares its fire-breathing namesake-on-the-label with another sauce you'll find on our shelves (TJ's Sriracha Sauce [sku 50828]), but it burns brightly with a flavor that's all its own. Made with jalapeños, tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and habanero pepper powder, with a dash of vinegar and a splash of lime juice, this is a creative condiment that's delicious on everything from eggs, salads, and burgers to enchiladas and fried rice. On a heat scale of \"Meh\" to \"Yowza!!\" Green Dragon rates a solidly satisfying \"Whoa!\" (About a 7 on the more mundane 1-10 scale).

While most are chili based (for obvious reasons), variations are nearly limitless because whatever else is blended with the chilies brings about a distinct profile. Trader Joe's Yuzu Hot Sauce is definitely a kickin' sauce with a distinct profile-one that we think any spicy aficionado will want to add to his or her hot arsenal. Modeled after the flavors in a traditional Japanese chili paste called yuzu kosho, our Yuzu Hot Sauce is likewise set apart by the highly aromatic citrus flavor of the yuzu fruit. (Imagine a cross between a small grapefruit and a mandarin orange.) Our supplier, from the Osaka region of Japan, blends bright yuzu zest with chili peppers and salt, creating a combination of sweet, spicy, and salty flavors. These flavors are delivered in a vinegar base, which adds a touch of sour and makes our version a pourable sauce (versus a paste). The yellow-green sauce with its fragrant citrus aroma and fair amount of heat is an addicting fusion that makes any food 'pop.' Try it on beef, poultry, fish (cooked or raw), rice or vegetables. Incorporate some into your salad dressing, or marinade. Put a dash in your soup, or in your bloody mary¿ Outside of Japanese specialty stores, yuzu hot sauce is hard to come by-but it's so good, we wanted to make it easy for you to experience. Thus, we're offering the 3.4 fluid ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Yuzu Hot Sauce at a real value-$4.99. Find it on our grocery shelves with our other spicy condiments. 01.23. 17",

We all know someone who likes to put ketchup on everything, or that sees sriracha as a one-sauce-fits-all solution. Well, we're here today to introduce yet another condiment contender to the \"great on everything\" hall of fame: made from a smoky, savory mixture of crunchy garlic, onion, peppers and olive oil, Trader Joe's Chili Onion Crunch is now available for all of your savory seasoning needs - and we do mean all of them! Similar to the jars of chili oil with crunchy garlic you can find on the table of many Chinese restaurants, the genius of Chili Onion Crunch is in its simplicity: with just a handful of simple ingredients, it creates a remarkably deep flavor profile that manages to accentuate the flavors of anything else it's placed on. The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the olive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all the other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning. Which brings us to its application: we happily contend that Chili Onion Crunch truly does taste great on everything. Pizzas, burgers, burritos, hummus - anything and everything that you'd add hot sauce, steak sauce, or even just salt and pepper to, will benefit greatly from Chili Onion Crunch. Seriously: hot dogs, pasta, omelettes, chow mein - we really could keep going. We haven't tried it on ice cream yet, but we're certainly not ruling it out. Of course, at Trader Joe's, the spice that always goes with everything is value, so we're proud to say that Trader Joe's Chili Onion Crunch works well with that, too: we're selling six-ounce jars for $3.99, every day.

Its tangy, sweet-smokiness instantly ups the ante on grilled meat, ribs, and chicken, commanding center of the plate attention with the flick of a basting brush. Our Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce [sku 31314] was a longtime resident on our shelves that upheld this meaty tradition with aplomb, but over the years, its ingredient deck started to fall out of line with current trends. Retiring this old standby allowed us to make room for a new sauce that we think will be an instant classic: Trader Joe's Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce. Our Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce went through extensive tasting panel review prior to its approval- after all, the old sauce was a customer favorite for a reason! (and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, either). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing the sugar and balancing the smoke. We think we accomplished it, with a base of tomato puree, brown sugar and molasses for tang and sweetness, amped up with natural hickory smoke flavor. Onion powder and garlic powder add savory notes, rounded out by paprika and chipotle powder for a smoky finish. This certified Organic BBQ Sauce is a nod to our tradition of striving to be better at what we do, everyday, and of introducing products that present an incredible value to our customers-which is exactly why we're selling 18-ounce bottles of this new & improved, Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce for $2.69.

Aside from its use in the afore-mentioned hearty soups and roasts that autumn is known for, it also goes great with everyday fare like pizza, chicken wings, tacos, and all sorts of savory breakfast options.

Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that's a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe's Gochujang, we reached out to a supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more. Our Gochujang's beautifully balanced elements of sweet and heat make it an excellent choice for flavoring proteins of all kinds, from barbecued beef to pan-seared porkloin, crispy fried chicken wings to hearty tofu stew. It can spice up burgers when used as a spread, can be enjoyed with french fries either on its own or mixed with mayo, and adds a whole new dimension of flavor when added to noodle soups. And for a fun, fiery appetizer, it's great for making kimchi-inspired quick pickles with salted smashed cucumbers. Gochujang",

A traditional ingredient in Japanese cuisine for more than a thousand years, it's making a highly anticipated debut to our grocery shelves. Trader Joe's White Miso Paste is made of fermented rice and soybeans, and like many fantastic, fermented foods, it has a complex flavor-a mix of savory, salty, and umami. Our supplier is a 5th generation miso maker in Japan. Their process involves a shorter-than-standard fermentation period to yield a delicate, umami flavor, making this a very versatile Miso. Most commonly used in savory preparations, White Miso adds depth to soups, sauces, and dressings. You can use it in marinades for meats, fish, and tofu, or as a dip for crudité. Because of its short ferment, it adds balance and pleasant dimension to baked goods, without making them too salty or savory. Miso chocolate chip cookies, anyone? Best yet, since we've suggested such a variety of ways to use this White Miso Paste-a little here, a little there-it comes in a handy, resealable pouch to help keep it fresher longer.

A truly great hot sauce-and we're talking about the kind you can put on absolutely anything-needs to strike a balance between its savory, tart, textural, and spicy elements. And we're here to tell you today that Trader Joe's Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce is a truly great hot sauce. Inside each bottle, Jalapeño and Garlic work hand in glove to produce a flavor profile that effortlessly balances savory and spicy, salty and sour, chunky and pourable, all in a way that makes it a marvelous match for tacos, eggs, nachos, potatoes, and pretty much anything else that could use an extra kick of flavor. Made with a base of puréed, brined jalapeños and garlic grown in Gilory, CA (the \"Garlic Capital of the World,\" no less!) our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce's relatively thick consistency, captivating aromatics, and steady, building heat all work together in harmony to create a consummate catch-all condiment. We especially like it over something warm and crispy, like a basket of freshly air-fried Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries [sku 73594]. Another hot tip: Our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce may just be your new best friend at the breakfast table.

Over the course of its two-and-a-half-millennia-long legacy, chutney has taken many forms, incorporating ingredients as far ranging as eggplants, radishes, pumpkins, and peanuts. You might be most familiar with the tamarind, mint, or mango chutneys offered by restaurants that specialize in Indian and South Asian cuisine. It's the last of these that serves as the inspiration for Trader Joe's Sri Lankan Organic Mango Chutney, a simultaneously sweet, savory, and spicy spread that brings a captivatingly complex hit of flavor to everything from curries and charcuterie boards, to sandwiches and samosas, to roti wraps and roasted meats. Made for us by a supplier in Sri Lanka, this magnificently Mango-forward Chutney is made with a thick, yet smooth and spreadable base of organic cane sugar and organic coconut sap vinegar, to which our supplier adds big, toothsome chunks of organic mango. They then flavor each batch with a suite of awesomely aromatic (and organic!) spices and seasonings that includes cinnamon, cardamom, chili powder, and garlic. Expertly balanced between its savory, sweet, and heat-based elements, the sky's the limit with this vibrantly versatile Chutney. Try spooning a bit over pizza or pork chops, onto a freshly baked Organic Biscuit [sku 73768] or toasted Tandoori Naan [sku 77677], or into a grilled cheese sandwich.

Cultivated on the island of Sicily since the 10th century (it isn't called the \"Lemon Riviera\" for nothing), Sicilian lemons are known for their aromatic, slightly oily peels and bright, sour-yet- slightly-less-acidic flavor-and Trader Joe's Organic 100% Sicilian Lemon Juice captures the essence of an Italian lemon grove in a bottle. We know what you're thinking: \"Gee, Trader Joe's, couldn't I just squeeze my own organic lemons?\" Why, certainly you can! Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy, as they say. But squeezing your own organic Silcilian lemons might be a little trickier, as Sicilian lemons aren't as commonly found in stateside stores. Plus, you simply can't argue with the sheer convenience of having not-from-concentrate Lemon Juice on-demand. And whereas most bottled lemon juice is made from concentrate and infused with preservatives, ours contains nothing but pure, freshly-pressed & pasteurized Organic 100% Sicilian Lemon Juice.

On tasting it, you'll likely first notice its rich, luxuriously thick consistency, then the savory, umami-filled notes of its white miso paste base, which perfectly leads into the pleasantly tart tones of its mixed-in yuzu zest and yuzu juice. Then, once you've had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it.. And indeed, the possibilities are practically endless: it's spectacular spread over grilled seafood, it's stupendous on a seared steak, and it adds remarkable depth of flavor to roast chicken. But that's just the beginning. From the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries [sku 96143] or Organic Chicken Nuggets [sku 67594]) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe's Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

The result was a strikingly smoother - yet still tantalizingly tart - sauce that would go on to become a darling of delicatessens and fine dining establishments alike. Made for us by a suppler in France, Trader Joe's Whole Grain Dijon Mustard builds on this classic profile by going all in on whole mustard seeds, giving every bite a nice, textural pop to go along with its charming, rustic tanginess. Lightly spicy and superbly spreadable, our Whole Grain Dijon Mustard can be used in pretty much any sandwich situation you can think of: it's a hit with hamburgers, a coup with cold cuts, and even goes great with grilled cheese. You can also use it as a dip for soft pretzels, cocktail wieners, or chicken tenders. But that's just the start: it can be mixed into salad dressings, casseroles, roasted vegetables, and all other sorts of savory fare.

The obvious answer is that a lot of entertaining goes on in the late fall through early winter, and a box containing a variety of tasty cookie treats is a welcome dessert option for most hosts. But it's also true that people entertain friends and family all year round. This thought led us to entertain the idea of a cookie assortment for the warmer months... which led us to one of our long-time cookie suppliers in Belgium... which led to the creation of Trader Joe's Belgian Cookie Assortment! The package contains two sealed trays to help maintain cookie crispness, in case the group you're entertaining isn't large enough to eat a whole box of 42 Cookies. Each tray includes three different types of Cookies, all made using a traditional, all-butter recipe. There are Lemon Flavored Waffle Cookies with a bright flavor and satisfying texture. There are classic Almond Butter Thins (the very same Cookies we've been selling every day since 2004 [sku 67005]) that are thin and crisp, with scattered slices of almond. This Assortment also includes a variation on the Almond Butter Thins that not only contain sliced almonds, but also Strawberry Flavored Bits made with fruit juices and purées. Trader Joe's Belgian Cookie Assortment can be easily plated and promptly presented for a nearly no-effort dessert that will patently please all the people you've gathered.

These oils tend to highlight the inherent \"green\" nature of the olives, and deliver a decidedly fruit-forward experience. On the other side of the spectrum is Trader Joe's Imported Olive Oil, a blend of extra virgin and refined olive oil that delivers a lighter-colored and more neutral-flavored oil.

All Extra Virgin Olive Oil is categorized as \"cold pressed\" because no high heat (at levels that could degrade the oil) or chemicals are used to extract the juice. In addition, the juice must meet certain levels in laboratory tasting for things like levels of peroxide and acidity. Extra Virgin Olive Oil must have no more than 0.8% acidity.

This brings the body both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids alongside those heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.

Avocados are also plentiful because individual trees actually bloom and produce fruit twice each year. An abundant avocado crop not only means plenty of avocados for eating, but it also equates to plenty left over for making Trader Joe's Avocado Oil. Avocado Oil is high in monounsaturated fats and an excellent cooking oil, with a smoke point of 520ºF (signifi- cantly higher than olive oil, which has a smoke point closer to 350ºF). The clean, delicate flavor is a great match for all kinds of uses, from sautéing to baking to searing to garnishing. Trader Joe's Avocado Oil is an excellent addition to your pantry, and a good alternative to olive or other vegeta- ble oils. We're selling each 16.9 fluid ounce bottle for $8.99, an excellent price for this versatile, light-tasting oil. 07.15. 16",

Recently, we had the opportunity to upgrade to Organic Toasted Sesame Oil-and that's just what we did! Our supplier takes organic sesame seeds grown in Mexico and toasts them before expeller-pressing them to yield viscous, golden-brown oil. The oil has a pleasant, toasted-sesame aroma that matches its nutty, toasty flavor. In fact, you'll recognize that same Asian-inspired flavor as in our conventional version-now with the assurance that you're enjoying a certified organic product.

And that's true for all of the avocado's formidable forms, whether it's mashed up in a flavorful guacamole, sliced up to add crucial texture to a sandwich or salad, or pressed into a lush, velvety oil. We've carried regular Avocado Oil for a while, and now, in response to Customer requests, we now offer it in spray-able form! Trader Joe's Avocado Spray Oil is made from top-tier, Mexican-grown avocados, picked at peak ripeness then expeller-pressed-sans heat & chemicals, of course. It's a relatively neutral oil with a mild scent, a gentle flavor and a notably high smoke point (around 500¿F), all of which make it a winning workhorse in the kitchen. Also, instead of arriving in an aerosol can, our Avocado Spray Oil benefits from bag-on- valve (BOV) technology, for a continuous spray minus the use of chemical propellants. Reach for it anytime you need cooking spray, whether you're greasing the grill for a BBQ, seasoning a skillet for a sauté, or even lubing-up a loaf pan before baking bread. Psssst! Psssssssst!

That's where tools like our Organic Canola Oil Spray come in handy: they're an easy way to apply a quick, even layer of oil without having to do much fussing or finagling with measuring spoons, spatulas, or paper towels. Add to that the fact that it uses an air pressure- based, non-aeorosol Bag-On-Valve spraying system rather than propellents, and you've got a seriously can-do can of Organic Canola Oil Spray on your hands. To use, simply hold the can about 6-12 inches away from the unheated cooking surface you'd like to be oiled, then depress the top button to spray, moving as needed to apply a nice, even coat. This Organic Canola has a smoke point of 375°F-400°F, making it ideal for using in sautés and stir fries, or baking in the oven at lower temperatures. It'll save you time, save you the hassle of extra dishes, and, of course, since this is Trader Joe's, each 4.73-oz. can will save you money, too. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

This was an improvement because it was made from sunflower seeds with higher levels of monounsaturated fats (namely, oleic acid), and lower levels of polyunsaturated fats. Customers loved this switch and we could've stopped there. But we didn't! The next natural step was to move from a conventional product to an organic one-and that's just what we've done! Trader Joe's Organic High-Oleic Sunflower Oil is made from the seeds of organic sunflowers grown in Mexico. Our Mexican supplier culls, cleans, and conditions the seeds; mechanically extracts the oil; and finally, filters it to yield a highly refined product. The finished Organic Sunflower Oil appears clear, with a light-yellow color, and smooth, neutral taste. And like its predecessor, it possesses the benefits of more monounsaturated fats, lower levels of polyunsaturated fats, and a high smoke point (around 450°F). In other words, it's excellent for roasting veggies, searing steaks, and deep frying, too! You want to know what else is the same as the previous, conventional version? The size and price.

   "description": "A typical olive harvest takes place over the course of three or four months, starting in mid-autumn and lasting through early winter. During that first month or so, the olives are still not quite fully ripe, so while it takes more of them to produce the same amount of oil as later-harvest olives, the oil that is produced tends to be much more flavorful-and, often, much more expensive, too. Unless, of course, you happen to be shopping at Trader Joe's. Because for a limited time, we're bringing in this super limited-edition Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil from the folks at Red Island® in Australia, and at a price that's a fraction of what you'd pay for similar, early- harvest olive oil elsewhere. Made with Early Harvest olives grown on a single estate, which are then cold pressed to preserve even more flavor, this extra special EVOO can be used in all the same kitchen contexts you'd employ for an everyday olive oil, like sautéeing or roasting. To take full advantage of its smooth and fruity profile, and nutty, delicately tannic finish, however, we find it truly excels when enjoyed as a base for a salad dressing, or when dunked with hunks of crusty bread.

Here, among the sloping, seaside hills, family-owned farms have cultivated olives for generations stretching back to the furthest edges of antiquity. Available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's for a limited time, Eliros Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes to us from a collective of these small, family farms, who hand-pick Koroneiki olives and cold extract them (which is to say, spin them in a centrifuge until the oil seperates from the fruit, all while keeping everything below 80°F). The cold extraction process further preserves the olives' rich flavor, resulting in a lush, buttery, and delightfully tangy EVOO that's especially suited for drizzling over grilled fish, finishing off a well-seared steak, and dipping with a nice hunk of bread. While many of the olive oils we carry on an everyday basis are excellent for cooking, Eliros Extra Virgin Olive Oil should be considered more of a finishing oil-we find that its full flavors and peppery notes hold up best when left unheated. Try drizzling it over a sheet pan of roasted veggies, mixing it into bold and full-bodied salad dressings, or giving it a toss with freshly cooked ravioli or tortellini just prior to serving. And you truly can't go wrong simply dipping it with a bit of focaccia or toasty baguette, as-is or seasoned with aromatic herbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and sweet Balsamic Vinegar [sku 53743].

Our products always have a story to tell. And here's the story of Trader Joe's Spanish Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Even now, in 2019, people still think first of Italy when thinking of olive oil. And while some very fine olive oil is produced in Italy, there is remarkably flavorful olive oil being produced in so many other places. Trader Joe's is a limited assortment store, meaning we don't carry 24 varieties of ketchup or a wall-full of mayonnaise. We tend to make exceptions to the whole \"limited assortment\" thing, though, when it comes to olive oil. There's just so much good stuff. From all over the world, really, from Italy to California, and Tunisia to Spain. Spain is a veritable treasure trove of olive groves - its rolling hills are home to some of the world's most flavorful olives, including those of the Picual, Picudo, and Hojiblanca varieties, which are used in our Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain. This blend of olives produces oil that is light green in color and a bit fruity, with a refreshing verdant flavor. Use this oil in dressings or marinades or for dipping your favorite crusty bread. In addition to flavor, a big benefit of Spanish olive oil is value.

Continuing to ride the wave, we simply couldn't resist adding Trader Joe's Organic Virgin Coconut Oil to the list. It starts with freshly harvested, de-husked, and grated Organic coconuts from the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The coconut meat is dried, and then cold-pressed and filtered to remove any remaining bits. That's the process, nothing more. No Solvents. No additives. What's more, this specific approach preserves the nutrients, flavor characteristics, and aromas of fresh coconut. It also allows us to call it \"Virgin\" Coconut Oil. Our Organic Virgin Coconut Oil will fluctuate from a solid to liquid state, depending on the temperature at which it's kept; so, don't be surprised if the solid-looking oil you bought in our cool store turns into a liquid when the jar's been stored in your warmer pantry. What's even more surprising than the changing state of your Coconut Oil will be its wide variety of uses; from cooking and baking, to skin care, to pulling (the process of oral detoxification by swishing oil in your mouth for 10 to 20 minutes). There's no shortage of applications for this versatile oil, and there's no shortage 16 ounce jars of Trader Joe's Organic Virgin Coconut Oil on our shelves.

Much of it, unfortunately, about companies trying to pass off lower grades of olive oil as extra virgin. Trader Joe's, we're happy to report, is not among those named. In fact, our olive oils are consistently praised for their authenticity, their quality, and their overall value compared to competitors. We know it's not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks! Among the selection, and one we're enjoying right now, is Trader Joe's Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil. In the bottle is cold-pressed oil from olives grown in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Greece. The oil is carefully blended in Italy and shipped to the United States, where it is packed exclusively for us. This particular blend creates an Extra Virgin Olive Oil that's golden green in color, pleasantly pungent and slightly grassy, with fruity flavors and a peppery finish.

People use it liberally to add verve to all kinds of dishes, from stir-frys and noodle soups-to meats and vegetables. Just a little transforms bland white rice into something of a meal. And when it comes to recipes, it often serves as the base for sauces and marinades. Despite its popularity, soy sauce's saltiness (say that ten times fast!) also means high sodium-something more and more people are choosing to avoid. Accordingly, the only soy sauce we sell is Trader Joe's Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce. With 530mg of sodium per 1 Tbsp. serving, it contains about 50% less sodium than leading soy sauce brands.

Some hot sauces blast you with heat upfront, thrilling your taste buds with immediate urgency. Others subtly sneak in heat, coupling their capsicum with complementary sensations and flavors. And others still, like Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce, build heat, bite by bite, until you reach a crescendo of spice so invigorating, that it paradoxically keeps you coming back for more. Made with Calabrian chili peppers sourced from a trusted pepper cultivator in Calabria, Italy (the \"toe\" of Italy's \"boot,\" if you will), our Italian Bomba Hot Sauce is our tribute to a centuries-old culinary tradition. Since the 1500s, Calabrian hot chili peppers have been a staple of Southern Italian cuisine, especially when crushed, fermented, and mixed into a firey hot condiment, just like this Bomba Sauce. The natural fruity notes of the peppers are amplified by the slightly pickled flavor and texture they take on during fermentation, making it particularly suited for pasta dishes and pizzas. And, like a ticking time bomb (\"Bomba\" is Italian for bomb, after all), the more you eat, the more heat develops, until it (and whatever you put it on) is bursting with flavor. While most specialty Italian grocers might charge you upwards of $8 or $9 for a jar of Calabrian pepper sauce, at Trader Joe's, you can find our 6.7-ounce jars of Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce, made from authentic Calabrian chilies and authentically imported from Italy, for the steaming hot price of $2.99.

   "description": "Bruschetta, coming from the Roman dialect verb \"bruscare\" means \"to toast\" or \"to roast over coals\" continuing a streak of pragmatic Italian naming conventions for their world famous cucina. The idea of toasting fresh bread and layering it with the likes of tomatoes, oils, fresh garlic, onions, salt, and basil is thought to be a custom as old as Rome itself. And those ingredients are just what we use to produce Trader Joe's Bruschetta. If a formula is as aged and celebrated as the culture that created it, we thought, why putz around with it and mess up a good thing. These simple ingredients come together in a macerated medley that elicits all of the familiar flavors one comes to think of when reaching for a tomato-based Italian topping. This is what makes it a wonderful choice to mix with some spaghetti or angel hair pasta as a less bold sauce than say marinara or Alfredo. But the real key is to use Trader Joe's Bruschetta alongside our fresh breads (toasted, of course) to make the appetizer dish also named bruschetta. It's here that the simple, yet effective flavors of our Bruschetta sauce shine. With the contrasting texture of a crispy bread, the smooth, decadent texture and flavors of our Bruschetta are bound to come to the front of your palette with every bite. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.",

It's honestly hard to imagine what global cuisine would look like (or, more importantly, taste like) without this singularly scrumptious root. And now, there's an easy way to incorporate its inimitable flavor profile to any dish you wish: Trader Joe's Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce combines the savory, herby sensations of ginger with the rich sweetness of coconut sugar, a touch of pickled garlic, and just a bit of soy sauce to make one seriously versatile condiment. You get sweet, spicy, salty, and garlicky - all in a single sauce. Made especially for us by a trusted supplier in Thailand, this Sweet Ginger Sauce is practically perfect for serving with a plate of pan-fried Pork Gyoza [sku 10602], but that's hardly where we'd stop. In fact, we find that its sweet, ginger-y heat makes for excellent dunking with all kinds of savory, meaty dishes, including chicken skewers, samosas, or crispy fried shrimp.

Some hot sauces, however, go beyond versatility to reach indispensability. That's certainly the case for Trader Joe's Peri-Peri Sauce, a one-sauce-fits-all condiment that combines the welcoming heat of fermented chilies and dried chili flakes, the tangy tartness of lemon juice, and the savory splendor of garlic to create a uniquely enchanting flavor profile that genuinely goes with everything. It's spicy, a little sour, even a little sweet, and has a smooth, creamy texture that keeps you coming back for more, bite after bite. Made for us by a supplier in South Africa, where peri-peri peppers are plentiful, this curiously complex Peri- Peri Sauce has an uncanny ability to not just match well with other foods, but to wake up and augment their flavors as well. From roasted chicken, to pork chops, to beer-battered fish, a nice drizzle of Peri-Peri can help bring out the inherent sweetness and depth of flavor to practically any protein. But that's not all: it adds a new dimension to roasted veggies, tater tot nachos, and jackfruit tacos, it provides a delightful kick to fried rice, potato salad, or hummus, and makes an ideal dipping sauce for fried pickles, calamari, or tofu nuggets. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

To make each batch, our supplier in Greece starts with a base of chopped green olives and almonds, to which they add a bright and savory pesto made with basil, olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan, along with walnuts, pine nuts, and a bit of vinegar. Everything's mixed together with sunflower oil until it reaches a texture that's somewhere between the smoothness of a traditional pesto and the chunkiness of a traditional tapenade, resulting in a highly versatile sauce, dip, and condiment that's bursting with briny, herby, umami, and garlicky notes. Try serving Trader Joe's Olive and Basil Pesto Sauce over a plate of Spaghetti [sku 47910], Gluten Free Egg Fettucine [sku 58643], or Cheese Tortellini [sku 21420] for an easy, olive-infused twist on pesto pasta.

Like the original, our Genova is garlicky, cheesy, and nutty, with a vibrant green hue owed to the fresh basil that's been pounded together with oil and other ingredients to create a delectable pasta partner. But the word \"pesto\" really just means \"to pound, or crush\" (in the Ligurian language of the Middle Ages), which seems to open up a world of possibilities. Taking the implicit cue, we've applied this namesake technique to a different group of ingredients, calling the final product: Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Almond Pesto Sauce. While there is still some basil in this Pesto, the real star of the show is Organic Roasted Red (Bell) Peppers. These are crushed with organic PDO Pecorino Romano cheese, organic almonds, organic onions, organic garlic, and a handful of organic herbs and spices, including marjoram, basil, and paprika. These ingredients are artfully emulsified with a combination of organic extra virgin olive oil and organic sunflower oil. The final flavors are delicately fine-tuned with touches of organic cane sugar, and organic apple cider vinegar. Although the fiery red-orange color of our Organic Roasted Red Pepper Pesto may look completely different from the pesto of the Genoese, the concept and application is very familiar. Simply take spoonfuls of this rich, roasted, cheesy, nutty, flavorful Sauce and toss it with your favorite cooked Trader Joe's pasta shape. One taste and we think you'll agree-Trader Joe's is totally crushing it in the pesto game! Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Almond Pesto Sauce",

Whether it's sweeping up the last bits of curry after a meal, scooping up chutney or garlic pickle, or even serving as an impromptu wrap, naan has an uncanny ability to literally carry all kinds of eating experiences. We were so inspired by its capabilities of conveyance, in fact, that we used it as the guiding inspiration for Trader Joe's Organic Naan Crackers. Shaped and flavored like buttery, fresh-from-the-oven naan, these Crackers trade the soft and fluffy texture of their namesake counterparts for a crisp, satisfying crunch that pairs perfectly with cheeses, hummus, or anything else that might need a lift from your plate to your lips. Our supplier carefully crafts each Organic Naan Cracker to resemble a miniaturized naan, complete with raised bubbles and browned edges. They make an excellent accessory to charcuterie boards and cheese plates, where their mild flavor and homey notes of ghee work together to accentuate more savory flavors. We personally like them best when paired with a creamy, richly aromatic dip, like a garlicky hummus or a quick, homemade raita.

Each batch starts as a sheet of sumptuously buttery, multi-layered puff pastry, which our supplier tops with a classically French suite of aromatic Herbes de Provence, along with a bit of garlic and onion. The sheets are then cut into Triangles and baked until they're both crisp and airy, and every bite strikes the ideal balance of rich, savory flavor and light, remarkably flaky texture. Our Herbes de Provence Triangles are equally excellent as part of an elaborate charcuterie board or cheese plate, as they are when enjoyed as a simple (albeit elegant) anytime snack. Try them as alternatives to pita bread or crackers the next time you're serving soft and creamy dips, like hummus, Tzatziki [sku 20405], or Garlic Spread-Dip [sku 54173]. And when soups and salads are on the menu, these Triangles are the ideal size for serving as sublimely crisp and savory croutons. Herbes de Provence Triangles",

They're traditionally made by rolling savory-seasoned dough into a flat, roughly rectangular, tongue-like shape, then baking them until they're superlatively crisp and snackable. For Trader Joe's Green Olive Flats, the newest addition to our snacks section, our supplier in Italy goes the extra step of mixing bits of green olive into theirs, which provides a perfectly piquant briny flavor into every bite. True to tradition, Trader Joe's Green Olive Flats make a truly exceptional serving surface for all kinds of cheeses: they provide a salty, savory boost when spread with our Triple Cream Brie [sku 55406], create a complementary conversation on the palate when eaten with a slice of herby Asiago with Rosemary and Olive Oil [sku 94533], and accentuate the allium elements of our English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions [sku 52381]. Of course, that goes even farther when compounded with some smoky charcuterie, like our very own Prosciutto [sku 98861]. And if you just happen to find yourself in need of a savory, crisp cracker, sans meat or cheese, our Green Olive Flats are always an excellent option. Green Olive Flats",

   "description": "In Scandinavia, rye has been a staple since at least the Middle Ages. But why rye? The key to rye's rise lies in this grassy crop's ability to flourish in a colder climate. It also had to do with rye's dense, earthy, and pleasantly sour character when milled and used in baked goods. Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips capitalize on rye's goodness by delivering this dark, delicious grain in a crisp, seedy cracker. A bakery in Norway makes our Sourdough Rye Chips. First, they bake bread from a wheat and rye sourdough that includes whole-grain rye berries, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds. The bread is thinly sliced, fried in sunflower oil, and finished with a touch of salt. Each curved, irregularly shaped Chip has a super crunch that leads to nutty notes and rich rye flavor. We enjoy Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips as a snack right out of the bag, but you can also use them to add crunch to your salad. And they're strong enough for dipping into something savory, such as Chunky Artichoke Jalapeño Dip [sku 54698]. For a more substantial snack, pair them with Oak Smoked Salmon Pieces [sku 71117] and thin slices of Denmark Havarti [sku 09356]. You'll find the 4.6-ounce bag on our shelves, every day.

However, it's not always an option, dietarily speaking, as most tend to be made with gluten and dairy ingredients. That's where Trader Joe's Savory Squares come in. Made with a mix of nut and seed flours, these superbly snackable Squares achieve an unmistakably Cheddar-y cheesiness and satisfyingly crispy crunch, all without the use of any gluten or animal-based ingredients.

Excellent for everything from simple, everyday snacking to scooping up your favorite creamy dip, these Savory Squares are ideal for bringing along on road trips, toting to board game nights, or packing into school lunches.

   "description": "Endlessly innovative, curiously crafty, and fiercely indepedent, Night Shift Brewing has gone from a home- brewing outift in 2007 to a cornerstone of the greater Boston craft brewng community in just a few short years. And now, they're working directly with us on a TJ's exclusive (and TJ's inspired) collaboration: Friendly Neighbor IPA. Inspired by the can-do attitudes and amiable spirit of our phenomenal Crew Members, this heartily hoppy IPA offers good-natured notes of orange peel, tropical fruit, and black tea, lively citrus aromas, and a pleasant, cheerful finish. Bold, hoppy, and refreshing all at once, Friendly Neighbor is one of those IPAs that keeps you coming back for more, sip after sip. We find it pairs especially well with spicy barbecue or sweet tropical fruit - or, if you're feeling extra neighborly, a nice mix of the two. Give it a whirl with carnitas tacos with mango salsa, crispy Coconut Shrimp [sku 58803] dipped in something hot and sweet, or a well-dressed teriyaki burger topped with a ring of grilled pineapple. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "We've carried Peak Organic Beers in some of our East Coast markets for a few years now. Only recently were we able to expand this great brand to other markets. About the Brewery: Peak is a craft brewing company, dedicated to making delicious beer using local, artisan and organic ingredients. With roots in home brewing back in the 90s, brewer Jon Cadoux set about combining his love for beer with an ethic for sustainability. Whenever possible, he would go out and find ingredients from local organic farmers for his homebrews. It was a defining day when Jon discovered that you don't need to sacrifice flavor for sustainability, but that better ingredients actually made the beer more delicious. About Peak Organic IPA This unique India Pale Ale features our favorite hops- Simcoe®, Amarillo® and Nugget. A generous Amarillo and Simcoe dry hop provide for an assertive, hop-forward nose and front palate. We don't use traditional bittering hops in our IPA, providing nothing but stimulating citrus and floral characteristics. Just the Facts...",

A house brand product always stocking our refrigerators and looking to always be stocked in yours! Heavy cream is the thick, fat-rich portion of milk that rises to the top of fresh milk and can be skimmed off. Mandated by law, heavy cream can have a fat content of no less than 36%. A higher milkfat content adds moisture and makes for a more gentle, tender texture to any baked good. The ability of heavy cream to hold its structure while whipped or thickened in a sauce, yet also create a featherweight lightness to any baked dessert means there is truly no substitute for it in the kitchen. Because of this, we're selling each one-pint carton of Trader Joe's Organic Heavy Whipping Cream for $3.99* every day of the week.

Once harvested, they're carefully dried in the summer sun by our trusted Turkish apricot supplier (and by Mother Nature, of course). What really makes these Dried Apricots Simply Amazing is the final step, which involves a gentle steaming. This unique method yields unbelievably Soft Apricots with a tender, chewy, almost velvety texture.

Had the fruit not been preserved in that briny liquid, it would not have survived the voyage from the East Indian tropics to the northeastern coast of the colonial United States. Of course, had Trader Joe's been in Boston in the late 17th century, colonists most certainly would have ignored the vinegary version in favor of our sweet (yet, unsweetened) Organic Dried Mangoes. Our Dried Mangoes are made from several different mango varieties-Kent, Haden, Ataulfo, and Keitt-grown in the Mexico. The fresh fruit is delivered to the nearest of a number of Mexican plants where it is simply washed, peeled, and sliced by hand, before being carefully placed on multi-layered racks for drying. Once dehydrated, the mangoes are hand-sorted (to remove the less than perfect pieces) and packed into the attractive, see-through bags you find on the shelf at your neighborhood Joe's. We call them \"unsweetened\" because we've added no sugar to these naturally sweet mangoes. They're \"unsulfured\" because their lovely orange color is pretty enough-and because we want everyone with sulfur allergies to enjoy them, too. Certified kosher and organic, this natural snack is so \"clean,\" it bears the exact same name as its short ingredients list: Organic Dried Mango. That's it!

Ataulfo mangoes, sometimes called \"honey mangoes\" or \"champagne mangoes,\" are indeed a special breed. Underneath their golden-yellow skin, these oblong-shaped mangoes have a much-less-fibrous flesh (compared with those other varieties), along with a very smooth, buttery texture. The fruit is naturally sweet and juicy. Our supplier in Mexico (the land where Ataulfos originate) takes advantage of these traits by peeling, pitting, and thinly slicing fully ripe Ataulfos, then expertly drying them. That's it! Nothing else is added to these Organic Mango Slices, so you get to enjoy pure, authentic Dried Ataulfo Mango, with its pleasantly chewy texture, and honey-sweet flavor. And like our other dried mango offerings, these make a delicious anytime snack that can even satisfy your candy cravings. They're also really tasty paired with something salty and crunchy, such as Trader Joe's Pretzel Sticks [sku 12564]. Organic Dried Ataulfo Mango Slices",

   "description": "We've been selling Trader Joe's Chile Spiced Mango for nearly a decade and a half. (Wow.) When it first arrived on our shelves, it made an enormous splash (metaphorically, it was a cannonball in the pool that is Trader Joe's), and its ripples have continued to this very day. Its story begins in Thailand with perfectly ripe, flavorful mango that's been specially selected for drying - it's sliced, sweetened, and dried carefully so that it retains enough of its moisture to be easy-eating. Once it hits the States, the dried mango is delivered to another longtime Trader Joe's supplier, where it is combined with a spicy but not-too-hot blend of paprika, cayenne pepper, sugar, and salt, then packed and delivered to us. It's a little sweet and packs some heat, so if you like sweet and spicy, say hello to your new best friend. And if you're looking for the perfect - and likely unexpected - snack food to serve with beer at a summertime soirée, there's nothing we can recommend as highly as our Chile Spiced Mango. Have faith in us on this one; we wouldn't steer you wrong. We're selling this super snack in eight ounce bags for $2.49 each. It's in the dried fruit and nut section.",

Our supplier dries several varieties of mango for us, so depending on what's most ripe when it's drying time, you could find slices of Kent, Haden, Keitt, or Ataulfo mangoes inside the bag. Still, that's all you'll find. No additives, no preservatives, no colors. Just Mango Slices. Trader Joe's Just Mango Slices are dried and packed for us by a supplier that's been in the business of drying tropical fruit for more than 20 years. The fruit is peeled, seeded, and sliced by hand - the slices aren't uniform in size or shape, but they are loaded with fresh, naturally-sweet mango flavor. Fun fruit fact: it takes five pounds of tree-ripened, fresh mangoes to make each six ounce bag of Trader Joe's Just Mango Slices. And that makes our price of $2.99 for that six ounce bag pretty darn impressive. Even more impressive? That's the same price we've offered on these Slices for at least four years running.

But still, it's not uncommon for us to get the question, \"How can mango be simultaneously soft, juicy, and dried?\" It's a good question, and one that deserves an answer. So we'll give it a go. This is Chokanan mango, grown in Thailand, where it is harvested at the peak of ripeness, then peeled and sliced into strips (it's the same type of mango you'll find in our Chile Spiced Mango [sku 81702]). The drying process is unique in that it uses vegetable-based glycerin to keep the mango soft - but never mushy - and mango juice is added in to give it a little extra moisture and further intensify the mango flavor. If you like the taste of mango, but find peeling a fresh mango a hassle, or you're not a fan of the typically tougher texture of traditional dried mango, Trader Joe's Soft & Juicy Mango is right on the money for you. We're selling it in six ounce bags for $1.99, not very much money for such a satisfyingly sweet treat. You'll find this Soft & Juicy Mango only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.",

The next player in that evolution, which happens to be shaped like a disk, is Trader Joe's Nothing But Fruit & Nuts-Fig Walnut. On a trip to Turkey, our Product Innovator discovered a supplier that was not only packaging dried fruit and nuts, but grinding them together. They extrude the ground nuts & fruit through a cylinder and slice it into disks (about two inches in diameter), which are individually wrapped to preserve their freshness and flavor. The tight seal around these disks means nothing needs to be added to extend shelf life, so you get earthy walnuts and sweet, chewy figs in every bite-and nothing else. Another benefit of their packaging is portability at any temperature. Drop a few into your purse or backpack for a delicious, on the go treat.

Never before had we tried something that so captured the experience of enjoying a jubilantly juicy passion fruit, while remaining rather un-juicy-and, we might add, un-messy. We knew right away that it was destined for our shelves, in the form of Trader Joe's Passion Fruit Rounds. Our supplier in Vietnam-an expert in all things dried fruit-makes each bag of our Passion Fruit Rounds by taking passion fruit seeds, along with the sweet, tart, and delighftully tropical pulp that surrounds them, and combines them with a bit of apple juice and sugar to provide some extra body. They then pour the whole mixture into disc-shaped molds, and dehydrate the whole mix it until it reaches a charmingly chewy texture. Together, the combo of sweet and sour, chewy and crunchy (courtesy of the generously-studded seeds throughout) create a harmonious balance that's as unique as the passion fruit itself is.

Unlike much of the dried papaya on the market, our Dried Australian Red Papaya contains just one ingredient: Red Papaya-no added sugars or preservatives here, folks! It's just unsweetened, unsulfured, tropical-tasting Red Papaya, which our supplier carefully hand-picks, slices, and dries to chewy-not tough-perfection. So go ahead, papay-ile a few slices on your snack plate. Add them to homemade trek mixes. Use them to add bursts of tropical flavor to your morning oatmeal or yogurt¿ or simply snack on 'em straight out of the bag! Dried Australian Red Papaya",

Well, with one look at this packaging, you may notice it isn't the elongated, curved fruit you're accustomed to peeling and preying upon with your palate, but a pre-peeled, parched, and portioned piece of the fresh fruit. Trader Joe's Organic Banana Chips are a dried fruit snack that allow you to get that sweet, irreplaceable banana flavor as a preserved snack in a resealable bag anytime, for use in a homemade trek mix, or any number of dessert recipes. Our chips come to us from the Philippines, where banana trees thrive in their hot and humid climate all year round, ideal for the banana plant's growth. The bananas are picked and peeled at peak ripeness, sliced into coin- sized medallions, and lightly fried in organic coconut oil, with a bit of organic evaporated cane juice mixed in to amount to the scrumptiously sweet flavor you have before you. Our Organic Banana Chips surely have a sensationally crunchy bite that'll make you go bananas and have you keeping a bag on your person at all times. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.",

These bright and bubbly bever- ages are an easy antidote to a hot summer's day, and with their subtle, fruity flavors that don't overpower (or over-sweeten) the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the everyday act of hydration. So when the time came for us to get into the business of fizziness, we knew we couldn't just do with any ordinary seltzer. No, to reach a new caliber of carbonation, we eschewed flavor agents and sweeteners and used real, organic fruit juices to create Trader Joe's Seltzers With A Splash, the new standard for effervescent excellence. Made with only three simple ingredients (carbonated water, organic lemon juice, and organic ginger juice), Selt- zers With A Splash Of Lemon and Ginger Juice harmoniously combines the refreshing fizz of a seltzer water with the lightly sweet taste of lemon juice and unmistakeable flavor of ginger. The blend of ginger and lemon creates a delightfully aromatic, but never overpowering, drinking experience that's truly invigorating. Striking a sensational balance between fullness of flavor and easy-going drinkability, it makes for a great companion for mid-morning hikes or outdoor summer concerts. No doubt, one of the best aspects of flavored seltzer is its anytime versatility. Thirsty after a long day of work? Make like the hip kids and crack open a can, right out of the refrigerator.

   "description": "Black raspberry is a fairly popular flavor for specialty ice creams and frozen yogurt, but it's a berry hard to find in non-frozen yogurt. Leave it to Trader Joe's to bring you an uncommon product that is uncommonly good! Are you ready for our Nonfat Black Raspberry Greek Yogurt? It all begins with Grade A skim milk from cows that have not been treated with rBST. While some Greek \"styled\" yogurt is created purely with thickening agents, our authentic process involves the traditional method of straining the curdled milk to remove the whey. This method yields a thick and creamy curd, into which we turn some coveted Oregon black raspberries. These dark-pigmented \"aggregate\" fruits are extremely high in antioxidants-about three times more than blueberries. Though research into the health-boosting potential of antioxidant-rich foods is ongoing, it won't take any ongoing research (just one bite!) for you to discover the favorable flavor of these black beauties. They are less tart and less sweet than blackberries, bearing a pleasant fruitiness, which blends exquisitely with the soft tang of our yogurt. The black raspberry picking season may be very short-only three weeks in July-but for 99-cents you can pluck a 5.3-ounce container of Trader Joe's Nonfat Black Raspberry Greek Yogurt from our dairy case any old time you please.",

   "description": "Ever wonder how Greek yogurt is crafted? Do we culture the milk by reading each batch some epic Hellenic poetry? It couldn't hurt, however that's not quite how we do it... Each batch of Trader Joe's Coconut Cream Nonfat Greek Yogurt begins with grade A pasteurized skim milk-sourced from cows not treated with rBSt-and cane sugar-sweetened coconut cream. Then, the blend is heated, cooled to a desirable fermentation temperature (approximately 110° F), and blended with live & active bacterial cultures. While this bacteria grows and produces lactic acid, we prepare for the final step: straining. A thorough straining is ultimately what separates the mere mortals from gods of Greek yogurt, if you will. By carefully eliminating nearly all of the liquid from the whey, we're left with nothing but creamy, concentrated yogurt packed with a veritable Parthenon of pleasant texture & tang-which are, after all, what Greek yogurt is known for. Our Greek Yogurt is also known for its price. We're selling each 5.3-ounce cup of Trader Joe's Coconut Cream Nonfat Greek Yogurt for 99¢,* every day.

Legend says that the prophet Mohammad first gifted the rare Kefir \"grains\" required to make this drink to the people of the Caucasus re- gion. Thankfully, it was eventually shared with the Russian people, and the world's been Kefir-keen ever since. Something that could make the world even more Kefir-keen? Trader Joe's Whole Milk Mango Kefir, of course! We offer a few Kefir products already, like Low Fat Blueberry Kefir [sku 54006] and Low Fat Plain Kefir [sku 58236], but this Kefir stands out for its flavor-Mango-and its milkfat content-whole. Whole milk provides a thicker, creamier consistency than milks with fat removed. Our Mango Kefir is fermented, or cultured, for 14 to 16 hours; for comparison, most yogurts are cultured for just two to three hours. Those twelve-plus extra hours allow the twelve active cultures (named on the bottle) to feast on the natural milk-sugars (lactose) present in the whole milk. The result is a dairy drink that's creamy, smooth, slightly tart, and just a little bit fizzy. The natural mango flavor that turns this Kefir tropical makes it a great companion to our Organic Mango Pas- sion Granola [sku 81804]. Add it to a smoothie with other tropical fruits, or drink it straight. Whichever way you choose, your taste buds will surely love the bright mango flavor, and your gut will surely love the probiotic benefits. Each 32 fluid-ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Whole Milk Mango Kefir is just $2.99. Go Kefir crazy, we dare you. 10.03. 16",

Such a suc- cessful symbiotic relationship requires, at times, change; in this case, it means supplying new, exciting, and desirable products. Like Trader Joe's Vanilla Bean Greek Whole Milk Yogurt. One spoonful and you'll be delighted by the exquisite vanilla flavor imbued in this whole milk yogurt. Greek yo- gurt, best known for its tart flavor and thick texture, becomes all the more velvety when made with whole milk. Whole milk has risen as a trend in the dairy scene, mainly for its creamier texture and less processed nature. A Vanilla Bean base is mixed with Grade A pasteurized milk to result in this delectable yogurt high in protein. Since we use real vanilla bean, you'll see those characteristic little black specks throughout the product. Flavor you can see and taste (but especially taste). Mix our Vanilla Bean Greek Yogurt with a healthy serving of Just the Clusters Vanilla Almond Granola Cereal [sku 81814] for an extra crunch and an easy breakfast or snack. Or, use this Yogurt in place of ice cream and sprinkle in some Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips [sku 04529] for a sweet, dessert-y treat.

Yogurt is definitely a trend-driven category, and, no surprise, Greek yogurt is still the top trend. But that doesn't mean that it hasn't evolved. When we first got into the Greek yogurt business years ago, there wasn't much variety. Plain, fat free, 2%, and maybe a honey option. But that was more or less the range. Then came the flavors. So many flavors. Delicious flavors. Whole milk was suddenly on trend. And then whole milk without the flavors was in vogue. That brings us to now, and this Plain Greek Yogurt Made with Whole Milk. Here we have the utmost in Greek Yogurt simplicity - thick and creamy, smooth and tangy, strained to get that rich, luxurious texture that's kept Greek Yogurt on trend for so many years. It's high in protein and a good source of calcium, delcious on its own or topped with your favorite granola or fresh fruit. Use it as an alternative to sour cream in dips or on baked potatoes. Add it to your smoothie for a thick & creamy protein boost. We're offering Trader Joe's Plain Greek Yogurt Made with Whole Milk iin a 5.3 ounce cup, every day. You'll find it in our dairy case. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Plain Greek Yogurt Made with Whole Milk",

Icelanders call this yogurt skyr (pronounced \"skeer\"). We call it delicious. It's so delicious, in fact, that after experiencing it for ourselves in its land of origin, we decided to develop our very own version. Trader Joe's Icelandic Style Skyr Lowfat Raspberry Yogurt is made from milk that comes from cows never treated with rBST hormones. Being Lowfat, it contains 1.5% milkfat. It's also cultured after pasteurization, in order to preserve those live and active probiotics. And just like traditional skyr, our Icelandic Style Lowfat Raspberry Yogurt is strained so it becomes exceptionally thick & creamy. It's reminiscent of nonfat Greek yogurt-but even smoother and with slightly less bite. While our Icelandic Style Yogurt does have sour notes, our supplier also lightly sweetens it, which, along with its natural, residual sweetness, creates a beautiful balance. Plus, it's flavored with bits of raspberry to provide an extra pop of ripe, fruity fun into every bite. Enjoy Trader Joe's Raspberry Skyr by itself or mixed with even more berries and Muesli [sku 56580]. Use it in a smoothie for a calorically sound, protein boost-each 5.3-ounce serving contains 130 calories and 15 grams of protein. Or, if you're craving something sweeter, blend it with a bit of cream cheese & sugar, then layer it in a parfait with Raspberry Preserves [sku 87805] and chopped Unsalted Macadamias [sku 90035].

But did you know that's only part of the story? There's a dark secret behind much of what's marketed today as \"Greek\" yogurt. You see, to save both time and money, many yogurt manufacturers skip that all-important straining process, instead choosing to add thickeners to regular yogurt to achieve a similar, creamy texture. We find that more than a little disingenuous for a couple of reasons. One, real Greek plain yogurt has no thickeners. And two, real Greek yogurt is significantly higher in protein than its yogurt relatives, specifically because of that straining process.

With their significantly more substantial texture and delightfully concentrated tart flavor, Greek Yogurts offer a broader variety of uses and greater culinary possibilities than traditional yogurt, and nowhere is that more clear than in Trader Joe's Nonfat Greek Yogurt with Natural Vanilla Flavor, a longtime favorite of our dairy case. Made with grade-A pasteurized milk, our Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt has the texture of sour cream with the flavor of a light, delicious dessert. Its creamy structure and lightly sweet-tart flavor profile make it a natural choice for parfaits and baking (most recipes that call for sour cream can be substitued 1:1 with Greek yogurt), or as a quick, effortless breakfast treat - especially when paired with some sliced bananas. You can find 16-ounce tubs of Trader Joe's Nonfat Greek Yogurt with Natural Vanilla Flavor at Trader Joe's for $2.99*, every day.

Dedicated purveyors of haute culture, we were way ahead of the trend when we first brought Strawberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Made with Whole Milk to our stores back in 2012. Made with strawberries, vanilla bean extractives, and whole milk from cows never treated with rBST (and other ingredient, like live & active cultures), it's sweet, creamy, and berry-licious, with five grams of protein per 5.3-ounce cup. Although a yogurt of this caliber commands attention on its own, it's also a sharp pairing partner. Picture it atop a bed of berries, or folded into granola, or frozen into a popsicle, or... so many options.

In the case of Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Raspberries, for example, it's done by freezing ripe raspberries, then lowering the atmospheric pressure around them to near-vacuum levels. After this, they're heated, which causes a curious reaction where the frozen water within the berries instantly transitions to a vapor, skipping the liquid phase entirely. And since raspberries are mostly water, what remains of each raspberry is super concentrated with their signature, sweet-tart flavor-in fact, it takes more than a half a pound of fresh raspberries to make each 1.2-ounce pouch of our Freeze Dried Raspberries. But you didn't come here for a science lesson-you came here because you love sweet, crisp, fruity snacks! And that's precisely what Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Raspberries are.

   "description": "\"Dispatch the cock!\" One might alternatively say, \"Expedite the chicken!\" The theory goes that some hungry Irishman came up with this poultry preparation method that involves the splitting and flattening of a chicken, thus accelerating the rate of cooking, since more of surface area is in touch with the grill or other cooking sur- face. In short, cooking time is shortened, and the done bird is moister (breasts don't overcook while the rest of the bird finishes), with lots of nice, evenly crisp skin. While Spatchcocking isn't necessarily brain surgery, it does take some extra work in the kitchen, which some feel negates the time you save actually cooking the bird. Trader Joe's negates this negation by providing a fully Spatchcocked Chicken, ready to grill or roast. Not only is it already 'butterflied' for you, it is also pre-seasoned; soaked in a brine with orange and lime juices, and marinated in extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, parsley, and lemon slices. Remove Trader Joe's Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken from its package (leave the lemon slices in tact and don't rinse it), and put it on a pre-heated grill skin-side down until it's well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165ºF on a meat thermometer. Alternately, you can lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking pan and cook at 375ºF in your oven for about an hour. (Cooking time varies according to the size of your bird.) We've enthusiastically dispatched two-and-a-half to three-pound Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chickens to all our Trader Joe's locations, where you can snatch your own for $3.99 per pound.

But the especially important part of shawarma is the delicious, savory spice blend that's used on meats cooked in this way. It's this crucial component that makes our new Trader Joe's Shawarma Chicken Thighs so wondrously good. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a shawarma spice marinade made of onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, turmeric, and parsley. Yes, we used almost the entire spice rack, but each one is vitally important, adding just the right amount of flavor to create glorious Shawarma Chicken Thighs. Though it'd be handy, you do not need to have a vertical spit installed in your home to cook this Shawarma Chicken; a grill or an oven will do just fine. More than fine, actually. Grilling leaves you with perfectly charred chicken thighs, while baking results in tender, moist meat.

Once you've done your desired prep, those Thighs are ready for the grill! You can also bake 'em in the oven for an equally juicy, flavorful entrée. (You can even crisp the skin on the stove top for about 10 minutes before baking-and you will want to do this.) We're selling each random-weight package of All Natural Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs for $1.99 per pound. That's an outstanding value for this summer-friendly product that you'll surely want to become friendly with this summer. You'll find it in our fresh meat case, but only during these summer months. 04.30. 18 SUMMER",

   "description": "Organic, free-range chicken is the most popular type of chicken we sell, so when presented with the chance to expand upon our existing organic chicken offerings, we were very intrigued. Then, when our fresh meat Buyer presented our tasting panel with a new, rarely-before-seen \"Strip\" cut, we were sold. Trader Joe's Organic Boneless & Skinless Chicken Breast Strips couldn't be more convenient. Sure, you could buy a bunch of breasts and slice 'em yourself, but if Strips are what you're after, why not save yourself the hassle? Our Chicken Breast Strips come already boneless, skinless, and pre-cut into perfectly sized, even strips. They're USDA-certified organic, and they're from free-range chickens that are raised on an all-vegetarian diet and never given antibiotics. Trust us when we say that this is one versatile cut of poultry-Organic Chicken Breast Strips can be cooked and used however you fancy. Whether you prefer to bake or to boil, to simmer or to sauté, they make a perfect addition to stir-fries, salads, pastas, rice dishes, and more. They also lend themselves beautifully to battering and frying (or breading and baking) and/or can easily stand alone as a center-of-the-protein. In addition to being versatile, this cut is also new-to-market and hard-to-find. Still, we believe that hard-to-find shouldn't equal hard-to-afford, so we're offering Trader Joe's Organic Boneless & Skinless Chicken Breast Strips for $6.99 per pound-a fantastic, everyday value that you'll find in our fresh meat cases. 02.26. 18",

Indeed, as Chef Keller states, the simple joy of a perfectly roast chicken is truly accessible to anyone. All one needs is a few extra ingredients and seasonings, a nice, hot oven, and, of course, a fresh, tender chicken. And for our money, you can't go wrong with Trader Joe's Young Whole Chicken, a simple, delicious bird that's suitable for all your particular poultry needs, but that's especially great for roasting. Minimally processed, and prepared with no artificial colors or flavors, Trader Joe's Whole Young Chicken can be used for roasts, soups, broths, and slow cooker recipes. It can be spatchcocked and grilled, chopped and tandoori-baked, or quartered and fried.

Practicing sustainable farming and observing all Jewish dietary laws under strict rabbinical supervision, Empire¿ is known to produce some of the highest-quality, best-tasting Kosher Chicken around. And it's not just for those who keep kosher. Many of our Customers tell us they prefer to buy Empire Kosher¿ Natural Chicken because of the company's definition of \"Natural ,\" which states that all Empire¿ products \"[meet the] brand's humane policy for raising chicken on family farms in a stress-free environment.\" (The birds are also vegetarian fed, never given any hormones or antibiotics, and U.S.-hatched, raised, and harvested.)

   "description": "Among the common cuts of meat, chicken thighs might just make the most compelling canvas for seasonings, sauces, and marinades. Since chicken thighs have a relatively higher fat content, they're typically more juicy and flavorful from the start, which tends to create all the more exciting interactions with other flavors. Case in point: Trader Joe's Savory Herbed Chicken Thighs. Each package contains boneless, skinless cuts of Chicken Thigh that have been seasoned with a sublimely savory marinade that's made with aromatic herbs like basil, cilantro, and mint, along with garlic, shredded lemon peel, crushed chili peppers, and even a bit of fish sauce for an extra umami kick. This mix of bold herbs, seasonings, and aromatics, combined with the natural juiciness and richness of the Chicken Thighs, creates a uniquely delicious flavor profile once they're fully cooked. Speaking of which, since they're pre-marinated and ready to go, cooking is a breeze: simply grill, roast, or pan-fry until a thermometer in their internal temperature reads 165°F on a meat thermometer. After that, it's simply a matter of picking a side to serve them with: we like them with a bit of Organic Cauliflower Rice [sku 54241], some steamed veggies, or a fully-loaded baked potato, ourselves.

   "description": "Want a hot tip? Or rather, hot Tips? Here's what you do: Go to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and pick up a package of Balsamic Rosemary Beef Steak Tips. Heat your grill to medium-high, then open the package and empty the chunks of choice beef (cut from the upper two-thirds portion of the bottom sirloin) onto a large plate or tray and lightly spray the meat with Avocado Oil Spray [sku 70738]. Then, simply grill the meat 7 to 8 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F. Pull it off the grill and let it rest it for a few minutes before serving. The tasty result is tender, sweet and savory Steak Tips, owing their flavor to the Balsamic vinegar and Rosemary marinade with which they were prepared-ahead of time, by us! Here's another tip: if you'd rather not use the barbecue, these Beef Steak Tips are just as sweet and savory (and simple) when cooked in a stovetop skillet, or broiled in your oven.

The tender is an aptly named cut from the chicken due to the delicate, tender texture when cooked properly. Found directly behind the breast, it has a very similar texture and flavor profile to the breasts themselves, making them a versatile tool for any recipe that has boneless chicken on the menu. Because Trader Joe's All Natural Chicken Breast Tenders are already sectioned into smaller strips than whole breasts, they are perfect for recipes that would need your chicken to be deboned and thinly sliced. They make a great cut to create savory skewers or marinate and lay over a caesar salad.

A cross between the mandarin orange and the sweet orange, it is believed to have come from the West Indies early in the 20th century to Florida, where it was named for William Chase Temple. Planted widely and advertised as the \"Ten Dollar a Box Orange,\" the temple orange alarmed farmers of other, more costly oranges. This holds true to today at a retail of $1.99 for a 3lb bag, it's sure to get snapped up fast.",

The distinctive dark flesh color is due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. The degree of coloration depends on light, temperature and variety. Sometimes there is dark coloring on the exterior of the rind as well, depending on the variety of blood orange.",

It was enjoyed exclusively by royalty and reserved for lavish celebrations, thus inspiring the titles \"The King of Fruits\" and \"The Diamond of Fruits\".

Just leave it out at room temperature for 24-36 hours to let the fruit soften and allow the bright aromas to shine through. We promise it's worth the wait.

Oranges are jealous of the apple's milder acidity. Grapes feel insecure about their size, even next to the smallest of crab apples. But there is one apple varietal in particular that has even the other apples coveting: It's the Envy¿ Apple, and we're stocking it now at Trader Joe's. Indeed, there is much to envy of the Envy¿ Apple¿ beautiful rosy-red skin; lots of crispness and crunch; loads of full, sweet flavor; flesh that remains white, even after being cut. The Envy¿ Apple, originally cultivated in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, is a cross between a Braeburn and a Royal Gala. Officially patented in 2009, it's non- GMO, and naturally stores well; making for a fresher apple, by the time it makes its way to your mouth. Recently, there's been quite a customer-clamor for these Apples, which also serves to stoke the jealousy of the other fruits.

But you know what they say: all good things take time. And pineapples are most certainly good things. Finding the perfect pineapple can be somewhat of a treasure hunt, but at Trader Joe's, you'll strike gold every time. Grown for us in Costa Rica, our Pineapples are harvested at the peak of ripeness, when the golden fruit is heavy with bright, sweet-tart juice. To really unlock the Pineapple's potential, peel it, core it, and slice it into rounds, spears or chunks. Then serve those slices alone, in a fruit salad, in a smoothie, in a cocktail, blended with yogurt, etc. Pineapple also happens to be one of those fruits that's delicious fresh and cooked, so don't be afraid to grill or broil those slices. Or to add them to a pizza-if that's what floats your boat, never mind the naysayers! We're selling large, whole Pineapples for $2.99 each.

   "description": "You've likely been introduced to regular Thompson Seedless Grapes-but have you met their Sweet Baby siblings? If not, we're here to make the introduction! Sweet Baby Thompsons are essentially regular Thompsons that have grown on ungirdled grapevines. Girdling is the practice of carving out a thin ring of bark around the main vine trunk, effectively preventing water and nutrients from traveling back down the plant to the roots-while still allowing water to rise from the roots to the fruit, up through the center artery of the tree. Girdled vines cause grapes to retain more water, producing larger, less sweet fruit. But since Sweet Baby Thompsons grow as nature intended on uncut vines (probably why this variety is also called \"Natural Thompson Grapes\"), they don't swell as much with excess water, thus remaining smaller-and also wonderfully sweet! Our Sweet Baby Thompsons are grown in California and we're selling a one-pound pack for $2.49. It's a really grape deal.",

Over time, this tool becomes art itself, with its blending of colors and build up of impasto strokes. Like the artist's palette (and like our previous Salad Palette with Mango [sku 57190]), Trader Joe's Salad Palette Super Greens also begins with vibrant, separated colors-this time cooler shades: crunchy broccoli with a gradient of green; rustic, earth-toned walnuts; smooth light-green edamame and peas; dark-shaded, trimmed, green beans; all surrounding a bright white feta cheese in the center. You (The Artist) are invited to mix and mingle, turn and toss all these fresh ingredients, until they're an edible work of art, worthy of your personal palate (as in: 'sense of taste'). All these colors rest on a canvas of more \"greens\"-spinach, kale, and other greens... (exact mix may vary by region and season.)

This variety has a very thin rind with small wrinkled lines crossing around the outer skin. Inside, the bright greenish-cream colored flesh provides the mild taste of a honeydew melon and the sweeter flavor of the cantaloupe. Galia melons are primarily known as a dessert melon. Delicious eaten by itself, or sprinkle some salt, lemon or lime juice to bring out the flavor and sweetness in the melons. They are at their very best when chilled. Galia melons add sweetness to fruit salads and in refreshing drinks, such as fruit punches, margaritas or daiquiris. They pair well with ginger, seafood, mint and soft cheeses.",

Such is the case with the Gala Apple, an aptly named fruit if ever there was one. This Golden Delicious- Kidd's Orange Red hybrid originated in New Zealand in the 1920's - but from September through April, our just-harvested, fresh crop Galas only have to travel from the state of Washington. (They come from Chile and Argentina the rest of the year.) Trader Joe's Gala Apples are heart-shaped fruit with distinctively colored skin - yellow-orange with red striping. They're among the softer-eating apples, yet still crisp, making them good snacks for adults and kids alike. They're excellent for baking (did someone say pie?), delicious in garden salads - they bring with them a sweetness and crunch that's a great companion to greens and such - and pretty near perfect sliced and dipped into your favorite nut butter, cream cheese, or Speculoos [sku 96761]. And, like all apples, Gala Apples are good for you; among other things, you'll get 20% of the daily value of dietary fiber in every apple. So go on, throw a party, and make Galas your guests of honor. We're selling them for 49 cents each, a price that's worth celebrating, too! You'll find them in our fresh produce section.",

Rambutan gets its name, fittingly, from the Malay-Indonesian word rambut, meaning \"hair\"-a reference to its spiky, hairy appearance. And in Vietnam, the fruit is called chôm chôm, meaning \"messy hair.\" What looks like a strange, spiky, otherworldly object is actually a delicious tropical fruit-one that we're pleased to offer for a limited time. One question you might have: \"What should I expect when diving into a Rambutan?\" Well, the flavor is sweet and similar to that of grapes or lychee. Though they're traditionally enjoyed whole and fresh, their bright fruiti- ness works wonderfully in curries, smoothies, and jams. \"But how do I eat such a striking, unique fruit?\" Fortunately, there are illustrations on the label showing exactly how you can be on your way to enjoying this sweet fruit. Take one rambutan with both hands and twist the outer skin apart. Separate the skin and peel it away from the whitish, translucent fruit inside. Then, enjoy the fruit and discard the pit inside. We're selling 12-ounce packages of Rambutan for $4.99. As an opportunity buy, they'll only be around for a short amount of time-try some while you can! 06.12. 17",

Native Americans recognized wild blueberries for their pleasant flavor but also used them for medicinal purposes and as a coloring agent. Throughout the mid 1900's, domestic blueberry production spread to 13 states, Mexico, and multiple Canadian provinces including Florida, Georgia, and California through selective breeding making the blueberries more tolerant of higher temperatures. The Blue Bell variety hails originally from Australia. It is known for producing large berries with a unique, intensely sweet flavor. If \"purple\" had a flavor, this would be it. Blueberries are great by themselves but they are also extremely versatile. Use them fresh in salads, oatmeal, or granola. They're also great for cooked applications like muffins, pancakes and desserts. Try freezing them on a cookie sheet and storing for later use in smoothies.",

If only we could take credit. Alas, the watermelon appears to have originated in Africa's Kalahari Desert, with ancient hieroglyphics placing the first recorded harvest in Egypt about 5,000 years ago.

Here's a little insider information: the secret to great watermelon is all in the thumping and the scratching. Huh? That's right, thumping and scratching. When you \"thump\" the melon you should get a hollow sound, and the rind should be dull and easy to \"scratch.\" Also, be sure to find the yellow \"field spot,\" the place where the watermelon rested on the ground, soaking up the sun prior to harvest. Still unsure? At Trader Joe's, we'll be happy to do the thumping and scratching for you. Just ask.

Mexican avocados peak from November through January and are known for their creamy nutty flavor. Product Info: Hass is the most popular variety, accounting for approximately 95% of the total crop volume. Taste: Smooth and creamy like butter, thick and soft with a little nuttiness. Nutritional Benefits: The fat content in avocados is often considered a negative, but according to the American Heart Association the monounsaturated fat found in avocados is actually beneficial. In a serving, which is one fifth of a medium avocado, there are 50 calories and nearly 20 beneficial nutrients for our bodies. They're also high in fiber and potassium. Ripening an Avocado: The Organic 48cts will be pre-conditioned and should ripen within a few days, however the following info may be helpful for customers: ¿ To ripen an avocado, place the fruit in a plain brown paper bag and store at room temperature 65-75° until ready to eat (usually two to five days). ¿ Including an apple or banana in the bag accelerates the process because these fruits give off ethylene gas, a ripening agent. ¿ Ripe fruit can be refrigerated, but not for more than two or three days.

Tosca Pears are cross between Coscia (an early season pear that originated in Tuscany), and Williams (better known as the popular Bartlett pear here in the United States). The result is an early-season pear variety with a unique flavor that is extensively grown in Italy. We are offering Organic Tosca Pears that have been organically grown in the upper Wenatchee River Valley of Washington State. They are picked at the optimum point of sweetness and freshness-when they are medium to small sized and sporting greenish-yellow skin with an occasional red blush. Their shape is almost bell-like and their flavor is crisp and sweet with a juicy bite-perfect for baking into a pear tart, or poaching with honey and cinnamon. Of course, they are wonderful chilled and diced or sliced into a tuna or green salad. To bring them to full ripeness, store at room temperature and check them daily by gently pressing the neck of the pear with your thumb. A ripe pear will give slightly to pressure. We're selling three-pound bags of Organic Tosca Pears for $2.99-but only through September.

You'd think that the fact that people more readily reach for an apple or banana would pierce pear pride; on the contrary, this only serves to further puff up the massive egos of pears... and no pears have a bigger ego than our Jumbo Korean Shingo Pears. Our Korean Pears are extra large and very round, earning them the nickname \"Apple Pear\"-a name they feel is an affront to their distinctive pearness. They have the thinnest skin of any pear variety, meaning you don't have to peel them to enjoy them-just slice and eat! They are also superbly crisp, amazingly juicy, and really sweet- with just a touch of tang (in contrast to the buttery profile of other pears). This tang makes Korean Shingo Pears the perfect partner for a variety of creamy cheeses. Korean growers purposely cultivate fewer Shingo Pears per branch, and each one is fitted with its own little \"jacket\" while still connected to the tree. Aside from the obvious fashion benefit, these jackets ensure thin, smooth, perfect skin. Korean Shingos are picked when fully mature, but before they are fully ripe, at which time they experience a second fitting-this time with special \"socks.\" Their socks-along with the Pears' firmness at harvest-help to reduce bruising, and to maintain that shapely figure during transport. Whether you attribute it to vanity or just to really tasty, well-cultivated fruit, our Korean Shingo Pears provide an impressive eating experience.

Have you ever tasted a ripe peach? Sinking your teeth into that velvety skin to behold the perfect balance between sweet and tart with just a tad of acidity is simply¿ peachy. And so are the Yellow Peaches we're now selling in our stores. These are grown for us in California's fertile Central Valley. Each piece of fruit packs plenty of peachy punch, and we're selling each piece individually, allowing you to buy as many (or as few) as you like, and eliminating extra packaging. Peachy!

   "description": "Among the best parts of summer, in our humble opinion, are stone fruits. Peaches and plums, nectarines and apricots, and all of the variations and combinations of these, can turn an ordinary day into a spectacular one. This is no exaggeration. We have this experience daily at this time of year. One of our favorite modern stone fruit families are the Plumcots¿. These plum-apricot hybrids come in for too-few weeks each summer, and leave us wanting more. Throughout their short season, multiple varieties of Plumcots¿ will make an appearance on our shelves-each for a limited window of time. It's challenging to predict exactly which varieties we'll have on a given day-you might find red-skinned, red-fleshed Plumcots¿, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed Plumcots¿, or purple-skinned, orange-fleshed Plumcots¿. They're all a little different, but they're all bursting with vibrant flavors. If stone fruits are your thing, but you haven't yet discovered the Plumcot¿, now's your chance. We're selling them in a one pound package for $2.99 in East Coast stores and $2.79 in West Coast stores, throughout the season..",

   "description": "While we hate to elevate one species above any others, facts are facts: salmon seems to be our customers' favorite fish. And why shouldn't it be? It's rich, \"meaty,\" and generally mild; even non-fish-eaters will sometimes make exceptions for salmon. Which we're, of course, thrilled about, because we love salmon, too. In fact, we love it so much, that we recently redesigned the packaging on several of our salmon SKUs so that the fish is that much fresher when it reaches your table. Now packaged in aseptic, vacuum-sealed packaging, Trader Joe's BBQ Cut Fresh Atlantic Salmon fillets are from salmon that have been carefully raised in some of the world's most pristine salmon farms, at the foot of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Norway. The salmon are raised with care by experienced fish farmers and never given antibiotics in their feed, which you'll find at some fish farms. Norway's frigid waters make for tender, buttery, and well-marbled salmon-after all, fish need fat to keep warm! Thanks to their extra thick, skin-on \"BBQ Cut,\" these Fresh Atlantic Salmon fillets can really take the heat and are ideal for grilling, pan-searing, roasting, baking, or poaching. They're great to have on hand for protein- and-omega-rich dinners in a hurry. Simply brush the fish with a bit of olive oil or butter, sprinkle it with salt and pepper (or our Salmon Rub Seasoning Blend [sku 75289]) and cook as desired. Depending on how fancy you want to get here, dinner can be ready in as little as 15 minutes. BBQ Cut Fresh Atlantic Salmon",

Trader Joe's Sugar Snap Peas, in particular, have an altogether pleasing crispness to them, making them a delectable textural element when added to salads, stir fries, or seafood pastas. They're even excellent when raw, as part of an elaborate crudités spread or even just idle snacking with some Buttermilk Ranch Dressing [sku 74462] for dipping. Botanically speaking, Sugar Snap Peas are a cross between English peas and snow peas, which explains their best-of-both-worlds combo of crisp texture and delicately sweet flavor. In need of quick side dish? Sugar Snap Peas are ready just like that. Give them a brief sauté with some olive oil and sliced garlic, or even just microwave them in the bag they came in for two minutes or so. Easy!

Beneath that bright yellow, thin-skinned exterior is slightly seedy, tender flesh that develops an ever-so-faint vegetal sweetness when roasted or sautéed, and holds up nicely when sliced into planks, drizzled with Organic Extra Virgin Garlic Flavored Olive Oil [sku 96177], and charred on the grill. Yellow Squash makes for a tasty, lower- carb stand-in for pasta when spiralized and tossed with Rosatella Pasta Sauce [sku 76262], as well. Because \"peak season\" changes depending on the growing region and season, we offer Yellow Squash from California as well as Mexico to ensure we can provide top-notch quality and flavor throughout the year. Regardless of where its grown, you're sure to enjoy the incredible value we offer on one-pound packages of Trader Joe's Yellow Squash. You'll find them in our refrigerators, every day.

It was in the 20th century that spinach first got its \"superfood\" status - from a comic strip character, no less! And while it was silly when Popeye's muscles suddenly bulged after eating a can of spinach, there was also, in fact, some truth to that story. At Trader Joe's, we have fresh Organic Baby Spinach that definitely passes the Popeye test - and without the can, thankfully. It's loaded with nutrients, tastes great and is good for you any way you decide to enjoy it.

Hedden, 1893 - we're not making this up). We should be clear that the Supreme Court only got involved in the fruit v. vegetable debate due to a squabble over the Tarriff Act of 1883, not because they were concerned whether folks were slicing their tomatoes for salads or eating them out of hand like apples. In any case, we think they might have made a different decision if they'd been presented with Trader Joe's Organic Sugar Plum Tomatoes. These little morsels are in the cherry tomato family, but rather than being round, they're more oblong in shape. They're sweet, juicy, and delicious - just the kind of thing you'll want to pop into your mouth, like a grape, which happens to be a fruit. We'd rest our case there, but there's more to say!

Green Onions do in fact look like scallions to the untrained eye (e.g., our eyes until we learned this), except scallions haven't developed a bulb at all. Green Onions have. It's a subtle difference, but a difference nonetheless. Both scallions and Green Onions are white onions, harvested quite young, that feature long, straight, edible, green leaves and mild onion flavor. That mild onion flavor complements so many different foods. Add chopped green onions - leaves and bulbs together - to soups, stews, and sauces. Blend them into burgers and meatloaf. Or lightly salt them, char on your grill, and serve with fresh lime wedges and a dash of Chile Lime Seasoning - this way, they make excellent partners to steak, carne asada, grilled chicken, or grilled salmon. Of course, you can use Trader Joe's Green Onions as garnish. Just remember they're the kind of garnish you actually want to eat.

Can you even imagine how those numbers would increase if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors of the rainbow? We're on a mission to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe's and the Organic Carrots of Many Colors. A little history¿ until a few hundred years ago, carrots were most common in myriad colors. The Dutch combined a yellow carrot with a red one and came up with orange, their national color. These new carrots took hold and became the standard by which other carrots are judged. These days, the colorful originals are making a comeback, and while we're big fans of orange carrots, we also have a strong affinity for the Organic Carrots of Many Colors. Every two pound bag is filled with a random assortment of yellow, cream/white, red, and of course orange carrots. They all taste like carrots - no surprise there - but their color really pops on a plate. Slice these vibrant taproots into spears, present them on a tray, and serve them with your favorite dip - we humbly recommend our Onion Dip Mix as the dip for the job. Or toss them with olive oil, salt & pepper and roast them in a 400º oven for about 20 minutes - their hues will subdue when cooked, but their naturally sweet flavor will really shine and complement your entrée.

   "description": "Cruciferous vegetables from the family Brassicaceae of the species oleracea have become increasingly popular with our customers. In plain English, we're talking about Kale, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli, Green Cabbage & Red Cabbage. Individually, these plants possess plentiful nutrients and character. When chopped together, however, they present colorful texture, crunch and plenty of culinary potential. Tossed raw, they make a mighty salad. Quickly sautéed, steamed, roasted or creamed, they become a striking side. We've also discovered that somewhere in between-tossed raw with hot dressing-makes them equally remarkable. While they will wilt slightly, they retain their signature crunch and incredible colors. We like them with a warm mixture of our Fat Free Sesame Vinaigrette and Toasted Sesame Oil-it brings out the inherently nutty flavors of these rich greens. Cruciferous Crunch Collection of Chopped Kale, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli and Green Cabbage & red Cabbage is a true Trader Joe's exclusive, which of course means the value is second to none.

However, there's a certain type of beet fan-a hardcore beet enthusiast, one might say-who still wants more. For those who revel in the pleasure and versatility of raw, round, red roots, we've got good news: Trader Joe's Organic Beets have arrived! There's a good deal of beauty in these beets, starting with their appearance-scarlet bulbs, hand harvested and trimmed in the fields. They are rinsed and gently tumbled over brush rollers to remove the dirt-no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides to wash away, here! One more rinse and the beets are bagged by hand and shipped to our warehouses. Once they land in your hands, you'll discover the amazing culinary flexibility of these earthy, slightly sweet gems. Fresh beets can be prepared in almost any way imaginable: Bake them. Boil them. Grill them, or steam them. Leave them raw and grate, or shred them into salads. Use a mandoline to make large, thin slices that you can oven roast for a colorful alternative to potato chips. Use them in baked goods, stir-frys, smoothies, and just about anything else your brain and hands can cook up. Beat the bushes all you like, but you won't find trimmed and bagged raw beets elsewhere-certainly not at our special price of $1.49 for each one-pound bag. (That's the West Coast price. The price on the East Coast, and in the Midwest and Southeast is $1.69.) Yay, beets! 10.06. 14",

   "description": "A popular legend says that after the king of Peru gifted a new tomato variety to the king of Naples in the late eighteenth century, it was planted near the base of Mt. Vesuvius in the rich volcanic soils of Villagio Marzano sul Sarno. These were the forerunners of today's \"San Marzano\" tomatoes (supposedly), but it's hard to know what's really true-especially when one considers that Peru had no kingdom (or king!) two hundred years ago. That truth may be lost to the past, but the taste of Trader Joe's Heavenly Villagio Marzano® Tomatoes is a truth that is right here before us. With an oblong shape and vaguely pointed ends-these tomatoes are a miniature version of the original San Marzano variety. The deep red fruit has smooth skin that yields a pleasant 'pop' when bitten. Inside, there is more flesh than seeds, and a flavor that is slightly sweet, and not too acidic. Such a \"heavenly\" profile comes, not from the volcanic soils of the Campania region of Italy, but rather from hothouses located in the U.S. and Canada. The small size of our Heavenly Villagio Marzanos® makes them perfect for snacking. Sliced in half, they add juicy charm to a green salad. Diced and simmered with olive oil, garlic and basil, they live up to their heritage as the best of the best sauce tomatoes. One of the happiest verifiable truths of all is that our hothouse harvest of Trader Joe's Heavenly Villagio Marzano Tomatoes is ongoing and unlimited (unlike the brief, two month harvest of San Marzanos in Italy). In other words, they're available year-round! Packaged in a reclosable, recyclable plastic bag (that uses 65% less plastic than a clamshell), ten-ounces of these terrific tomatoes are in our stores every single day, for $2.79. 4.01.1 5",

   "description": "An exotic delicacy iconic to izakaya (Japanese tapas/appetizers/bar food), Shishito Peppers have become a ubiquitous and fashionable finger food of late. Here's why: Shishito Peppers are enormously delicious and a bit daring, couldn't be simpler to prepare, are famously finger-friendly, and make perfect appetizers. Native to Japan (perhaps via Portugal, some speculate), the slender, green peppers have delicate skin and a slightly pleated surface that makes for a fresh crunch raw or a tender bite cooked. They have a whisper of grassy and peppery flavor, with a faint note of citrus. And-here's the kicker-some (approximately one in ten) have a real kick! So popping peppers is a bit roulette-y: mild, mild, mild, POW!... The hit of heat and suspense are addicting. Minimal prep is the key to highlighting their bright flavor. Simply heat oil (olive or sesame) in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the peppers, turning occasionally, until they begin to blister on all sides. Sprinkle with a bit of sea salt-they are ready to enjoy! They are also wonderful grilled or deep fried, and partnered with a Soyaki-style sauce or Sriracha cream for dipping. They are ideal appetizers. They can also be tossed on top of pizzas or served alongside steaks. We've even seen them served as a cocktail garnish. Is it possible to propel the popularity of these peppers further? We think our price of $1.99-$2.29 for each six- ounce package of Trader Joe's Shishito Peppers will prove so. 1.16.1 5",

However, we've got a brand new seasonal salad that might change your idea of what constitutes cold-weather food. It's A Complete Salad, featur- ing Kale & Hemp Seeds. The foundation of this Salad is tender, baby Kale and crunchy Hemp Seeds-but if that were all, we'd have a hard time justifying the \"Complete\" in the title. Red and white radicchio leaves supplement the Kale to form the base. Slivered almonds partner with the Hemp Seeds for extra crunch. Parmesan cheese brings savory notes, while chewy, chopped dates lend a caramelly sweetness. All these flavors round it out, but it's the inclusion of a bright, Lemon Vinaigrette that really makes it Complete. Aside from the fact that this is just a really good tasting salad, it's also full of nutrients. One serving (one-fourth of the package) contains 7 grams of protein, and 3 grams of fiber. This salad is also an excellent source of vita- mins, notably vitamin A and vitamin C. And of course, the Hemp Seeds bring their Omega-3 fatty acids to the salad bowl. This triple-washed, Complete Salad with Kale & Hemp Seeds is completely ready to eat. Everything you need for a winter boost is inside the 13 ounce bag. Now that you've contemplated it-complete that thought by pick- ing up a bag for $3.99 on the West Coast, and $4.49 elsewhere (East Coast, Midwest, and Southeast). 11.30. 15",

While every sweet-potato fry you encounter may indeed be vivid orange, we've gotten our hands on fields full of California- and North Carolina-grown Murasaki Sweet Potatoes that will challenge your perception of these terrific tubers. Murasaki Sweet Potatoes are dark purple on the outside, and cream colored on the inside. Eye-catching! When you cut them open, your expectations simply don't match up with what you're seeing. They look like a russet, so they should taste like a russet, right? Nope. They're sweet, through and through, with just a hint of chestnut flavor. They're a bit fluffy (again, like a russet) and a little less moist than traditional sweet potatoes and yams, but if you're a sweet potato fan, these will definitely satisfy that craving. They are the same oblong-with-slightly-pointed-ends shape as more traditional varieties, if that helps you make the Murasaki leap. And they look so cool on a plate when they come out of the oven. Serve them with butter for a savory presentation, or go all the way sweet with a drizzle of maple syrup or honey.

Now, that we've got that out of the way¿ Also called the \"yam bean,\" (much easier to pronounce), jicama is native to Central and South America. It was originally cultivated by all major Mesoamerican civilizations. This root vegetable is shaped like an overgrown flat onion. It has papery, brown skin, which hides beneath it, crisp, white flesh. The Jicama's bulky size and odd shape make preparing it a cumbersome ordeal. This got us thinking: What if we took care of the painful prep stage for you? We presumed that if we did, more people would become eager fans of this refreshing, underutilized vegetable. So, we did. We peeled the skin and cut the flesh into ready-to-serve sticks. The mild, sweet-starchy flavor of jicama (sometimes described as a mix between pear flesh and potato flesh) makes the perfect blank canvas for dips-especially shaped like sticks, as these are. The wonderful crunch makes a great addition to fresh salsas and salads-just chop our sticks into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Jicama also works well cooked into stir-frys and soups. We're offering each 9.5-ounce container of Jicama Sticks for just $2.69, every day. (\"Sticks\" is pronounced STIX, just in case you were wondering.) 9.11.1 5",

Fast forward some seventy years-asked to describe this inspired, new cut of the coveted Cucurbita, the third-generation, Salinas Valley farming family mused that \"it zigs and it zags.\" Or so our story starts for Butternut Squash Zig-Zags. Intent on injecting fresh, creative energy to the cooking of vegetables, these pioneers dedicated years of intensive research and development to the unique cut. Shaped somewhere between fusilli and ribbon candy, in appearance alone these Zig-Zags have a gosh-those-look-fun-to-eat character. Contributing to that captivation, especially from the cook's perspective, is the fact that Butternut Zig-Zags have been cut, washed, and are ready to use. Fancifully shaped, approachably prepared, Butternut Squash Zig-Zags can be sautéed or roasted (with butter and sage or a squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro as seasoning), to give a classic side fresh energy. They can also be tossed into soups, stir-fries, or salads, or substituted for pasta. How about zig-zag cut butternut squash fries- yes! They are even poised to be crafted into something sweet-add apples and caramel to start. Like all of our product stories, the moral of the Butternut Squash Zig-Zags cuts straight to great value.

Noted for their sweetness, Vidalia Onions are a particularly essential allium, which is why we're proud to offer them in convenient, two-pound bags during the spring and summer months. While our valiant Vidalias can be used in any application that calls for an onion, they're particularly great for roasting, caramelizing, and quick-pickling-all of which will accentuate their natural sweetness. Raw, they're excellent for topping sandwiches, burgers, and hot dogs, and make an awesome ingredient for salads, salsas, and skewers.

Green cabbage, carrots, and radish have been chopped into small pieces and then mixed with romaine lettuce-and just the right amount of green onions and cilantro. Also included in the bag are pepitas, tortilla strips, cotija cheese, and a spicy avocado dressing-which gets its spiciness from poblano chiles. Simply put all ingredients in a bowl, toss, and enjoy the crunchy, delicious result. This Southwestern Salad is perfect as a side salad with a dinner of Chicken Verde Enchiladas [sku 58292]. Grill up Carne Asada [sku 75977] or Pollo Asado [sku 81293] and place on top for some added protein. Or, toss it up and have a bowl for lunch-and save the rest for later!

In the world of salad, there are seemingly endless choices, so how do you choose? Why not go with something new, something intriguing, something whose name sounds a bit like you're talking about a hip clergy member? Yes, friends, that would be Trader Joe's Kohlrabi Salad Blend. Kohlrabi is a relative of cabbage (its name derives from the German word for cabbage, actually) that's often mistaken for a root vegetable, though it does grow above ground. We've combined this mild, slightly sweet-tasting green with shrredded kale, golden beets, and red cabbage. These veggies, grown in California (in springtime, the cabbage is sourced from Arizona as well), come together to become a veritable superhero of a salad mix, and one you'll only find at Trader Joe's. Toss the Kohlrabi Salad Blend with your favorite dressing, or break the cardinal rule of summer and actually cook - it's delicious sautéed in olive oil with a bit of garlic and a sprinkling of sea salt, and only requires a few minutes on the stovetop.

   "description": "Did you know that we Americans consume more carrots than any other people in the world? On average, each one of us consumes 11.5 pounds of these robust roots a year. Can you imagine how those numbers would increase if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors of the rainbow? We're on a mission to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe's Cut & Peeled Organic Carrots of Many Colors. A little history: until a few hundred years ago, it was common to find carrots in a myriad of colors. Orange wasn't the default hue. That all changed, however, when the Dutch combined a yellow carrot with a red carrot and came up with an orange carrot-orange being their national color. These new carrots took over, quickly became the standard by which other carrots were judged. But guess what? The rainbow is back, baby! We already offer non-organic Les Petite Carrots of Many Colors [sku 57285] and whole Organic Carrots of Many Colors [51475], and now, for your snacking convenience, we bring you Cut & Peeled Organic Carrots of Many Colors, a.k.a \"baby cut\" Organic Carrots of Many Colors. In each bag, you'll find an assortment of orange, yellow, white, and purple snack-sized carrots, each color offering a slightly different flavor profile. Looking for a slightly sweeter carrot? Go for a purple carrot. A mildly nutty carrot? Try a white one. Cut & Peeled Organic Carrots of Many Colors are ideal for snacking and make a impressive crudités, served with dips, cheese, or charcuterie. We're selling each 12-ounce bag for $1.99 ($2.29 in our Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast stores). Look for them in our refrigerated produce section.",

   "description": "In 2015, we released our very first complete salad kit that wasn't actually a \"salad.\" Our Broccoli & Kale Slaw Kit [sku 55386] is, well, slaw (in the general sense of the word). And it's been a hit ever since. Trader Joe's Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit is our next foray into slaw kits, and it's a slaw kit that truly takes slaw kits to the next level. This recipe was dreamed up by one of our Buyers, who wanted to introduce a unique flavor profile to our se- lection of complete salad kits. A blend of shredded rainbow carrots, broccoli stalks, green cabbage, and kale comprises the \"slaw\" part of this Slaw. But it's the good stuff-the ingredients from which the Slaw got its name-that take this from an ordinary slaw into something profoundly delicious. Pepitas, chopped sun-dried apricots, and a creamy tahini orange dressing make this truly one-of-a-kind. Such a vibrant Slaw Kit allows for quick-and tasty-weekday meal prep. It's as easy as adding a piece of grilled salmon, Grilled Chicken Strips [sku 64873], or Falafel [sku 93935]. Serve it as a side dish to a larger meal, or toss a crunchy addition into sandwiches, wraps, or tacos. Yes, Trader Joe's Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit is innovative; and, yes, Trader Joe's Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit is a value. Innovation and value are two of our favorite things, after all.

While we're grateful for the glimpses of rainbows we do get, we're even more grateful for the newest, permanent rainbow found in our stores: Cal-Organic® Farms Organic Rainbow Radishes. Each package of Organic Rainbow Radishes contains about half a rainbow's worth of reddish, radish-y hues. There's no blue or green in the bunch, but you'll find beautiful shades of pink and purple, as well as a few white radishes thrown in for merry measure. Grown in fertile California soil, the brightly colored bulbs are harvested and hand- trimmed, so they come ready-to-go. They're firm, crunchy, and spicy-just like radishes should be- but not quite as spicy as their traditional, red radish counterparts. This might seem obvious, but there really isn't anything else in each bag of Cal-Organic® Farms Organic Rainbow Radishes except organically grown radishes. With this blank (yet colorful) slate, you have so many vibrant possibilities before you. Serve them raw, pickled, or roasted. Slice them up and add them to salads, sandwiches, soups, or tacos. Add them to a crudité plate alongside some hummus dip. Or, make radish chips by lining a baking sheet with thin Rainbow Radish slices, drizzling them with olive oil, sprinkling them with sea salt, and baking them at 400ºF for 12-15 minutes. Each 12-ounce bag of Cal-Organic® Farms Organic Rainbow Radishes is $2.99, every day.

   "description": "You may be familiar with Caesar Salad's origin story; back in 1924, or so the story goes, chef Caesar Cardini was about to close his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico for the night when a hungry customer asked for a salad. Nearly out of ingredients, Caesar whipped together what he had, and the now-classic Caesar Salad was born. As we quickly approach the Caesar Salad's 100th anniversary (where has the time gone?), the question is raised: how does one properly render tribute to such a sovereign of salads? How does one hail such a monarch of mixed greens? We came, we saw, we stepped up our game with Trader Joe's Organic Caesar Salad Kit. It's the classic crunchy, creamy, garlicky, and (most importantly) delicious Caesar Salad you know and love, ex- cept this time, it's all organic. In other words, each bag contains crisp, fresh-chopped leaves of organic Roamine lettuce, tasty shreds of organic parmesan cheese, splendidly seasoned organic croutons, and a rich, peppery salad dressing made entirely with organic ingredients. All you have to do is make like chef Caesar and mix them all together, and your conquest of dinner is complete. Like a certain other Caesar we can think of, you may be surprised at just how protean this salad can be-no need to confine it to just a side. Simply add some grilled steak, chicken, or shrimp, and you have a full-fledged entrée. Or, if you're feeling a little more adventurous, using this Caesar Salad as a basis for a flavorful wrap or as the topping to a turkey or salmon burger can turn a plebian sandwich experience into a full-fledged triumph. No matter how you use it, it's a value that even an emperor could appreciate: we're selling each 12 oz. bag for only $3.99, every day.

Cool romaine lettuce, shredded broccoli stalks and crisp radicchio form the sturdy base of this Salad, while celery, seasoned flatbread strips, and roasted chickpeas add major crunch. This collection of cool, crisp, and crunchy components is rounded out with tender dried tomatoes and crumbled feta cheese, and made complete with a packet of dressing that's fantastic in its own right: herby notes of basil and oregano and savory garlic, all swimming in a blend of extra virgin olive oil and tangy red wine vinegar.

Now, we're selling a new variety that is unique & beautiful in appearance, with a name that predicts just how much you'll like it¿ Enjoya Peppers, supplied by 4 Earth¿ Farms, start off green. As they grow, they turn red and develop vibrant, yellow-orange striations. The first plant with this intriguing appearance was discovered growing naturally in Est, Holland. The lucky botanist excitedly set to work with a team to cultivate this fresh, visually captivating variety. And, as you might guess, there's much more to enjoy than just the look of these Peppers¿ Enjoya are crisp & firm, with slightly denser walls than more common bell pepper varieties. They are sweetly aromatic, with a flavor that is equally sweet-almost fruit-like. This combination of looks & taste means Enjoya Peppers are ideal to kick up any recipe in which you'd use a pepper. Their color adds panache to any platter of raw vegetables. Slice them in rings to top your pizza; or make it a large dice to toss in a green salad. One of our favorite things to do is cut off the cap of a whole Enjoya, clean out the insides, and fill it with seasoned & browned TJ's All Natural Ground Turkey [sku 51125], mixed with our Riced Cauliflower [sku 55922].

Don't get us wrong; we love Caesar Salad (and we have a great Caesar Salad Kit). We also love expanding our palates and discovering new ways to enjoy a bowl of greens & things. Trader Joe's Yellow Curry Chopped Salad Kit is an excellent expression of this desire, available in a bag at your neighborhood TJ's. This Complete Salad Kit begins with a blend of chopped Romaine, crunchy red & green cabbages, carrot slivers, and a sprinkling of green onion slices. But this Salad, like so many others, is less about the greens, and more about the toppings and the dressing that adorn those greens. Here, we've included crunchy naan chips (think pita chips, but made with naan bread), cashew pieces, and golden raisins. Crunchy, chewy, and delicious, all the way through. The dressing? It's a salad-making revelation, this Yellow Curry Ginger Lime Vinaigrette. You may wonder if all those flavors really go together. Spoiler alert: they do! The flavors are so fresh, so new, so¿ now! And speaking of now, now would be a great time for you to scoot on over to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and grab yourself a bag (or four) of this Yellow Curry Chopped Salad Kit.

This slighter silhouette does create a rather significant difference in firmness and texture, which has given haricots a reputation for refinement. Trader Joe's Organic Haricots Verts, grown for us in the rich, volcanic soils of Guatemala, exemplify why: they're crisp, tender, fresh, and ready to be cooked to your specifications. Excellent for adding a nice crunch to salads and stir fries, superb for steaming and serving as a simple and elegant side, these Organic Haricots Verts are a legend among legumes. With their fresh taste and snappy texture, we find a light hand in preparation is best: just a few minutes in a steamer or in the skillet will bring out their flavor without sacrificing that satisfying crunch.

It's a classic slaw dressing that's creamy and slightly sweet-made with organic expeller pressed soybean oil and organic cider vinegar. Organic egg yolks contribute creaminess, while garlic, dehydrated onion, sea salt and black pepper bring a savory factor. Some organic cane sugar and organic lemon juice add just the right amount of sweet/tangy balance.

   "description": "People who love kale, love it for its earthy, green flavor and tender-chewy texture. They also love it for the variety of vitamins and minerals it supplies. But not all people love the fibrous stems that are often present, even in pre- cut, packaged kale. Those woody stems stick out in an otherwise pleasantly crunchy green salad. They can also make your green smoothie significantly less than smooth. For these reasons, we sought out a kale supplier who could bring us the best of kale, minus the unpleasant stems. And we found it in Earth Greens® Organic Green Kale. Grown organically in California and Arizona, this Kale already comes out of the fields with fewer stems than typical mature kale. Then it's trimmed and coarsely chopped to eliminate any large stem pieces that may still remain. The result is an excellent eating experience-whether your kale is boiled in a soup, sautéed and served with pasta, blended in a smoothie, or eaten fresh in a green salad. (Incidentally, this Kale is also triple-washed and ready-to-use, which is another plus!) Want to know another plus?

   "description": "Trader Joe's Complete Salad Kits provide a great opportunity to explore the flavors of regional cuisines, from Thailand, to the Southwestern United States, to Greece. A Za'atar Tango Salad Kit finds its inspiration in the cuisine of the eastern-most Mediterranean region. Tender, curly, red & green oak lettuces form the base, along with baby green tango, with its frilly leaves and longer stems that are ideal for catching and delivering salad toppings. And this Kit's toppings really bring the flavors! A separate packet includes sweetened diced dates, toasted sesame seeds, and salted pistachio pieces. It also contains flatbread strips that have been amped up with a zingy za'atar seasoning that incorporates parsley, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon oil, sesame oil, cumin oil, and rice hulls for some extra crunch. All these elements benefit from some balance, which is where the cucumber yogurt dressing comes in. It's creamy, cool, and an excellent complement for the savory flavors and crunchy textures.

   "description": "When we set out to create one our all-in-one salad kits, sometimes it comes down to simply testing out a theory. For example: just on a conceptual level alone, the mild, lightly grassy flavor and remarkably creamy texture of avocado should make it a natural companion to the savory, herby sensations of a classic ranch dressing. We put that theory into practice with Trader Joe's Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados. As it turns out, that theory was delightfully, deliciously correct. Don't you just love the scientific method? Like all our salad kits, this Avocado Ranch is a super quick and convenient way to add a side salad to practically any meal. It's a proven winner with pizza, a beauty with barbecue, and a certified sensation, even with something as simple as a sandwich. Or, if you'd prefer it as an entrée, just pop your favorite protein on top, an voilà-you've got a whole meal on your hands.

Is there any bad news about beets? Well, maybe prep time, if you're in a hurry; but you don't have to worry about that if you're talking about Trader Joe's Steamed & Peeled Baby Beets. True to their name, these babies are peeled and cooked - steamed in a sealed pouch, specifically, to retain their starry nutritional profile - ready to enjoy right out of the package. There is only one ingredient inside every package; baby beets from the Normandy region of France, where the rich soils and cool summertime temperatures combine to produce ideal growing conditions for sweet and tender beets. Beets are terrific in salads, and if you want to enjoy them warm, simply heat them in the microwave (heating instructions are on the package) and add them to a mélange of other veggies, soups or stews.

In addition to its relatively ubiquitous off-white color, cauliflower also comes in bright, royal purples, warm, muted oranges, and, when hybridized with broccoli, lush, lime greens. We've assembled all four in Trader Joe's Cauliflower of Many Colors, a multi-hued collection of cauliflower florets that are pre-cut, pre-washed, and ready to use in any number of culinary situations. Grown in Gautemala, these Many-Colored florets are as versatile as they are vibrant. They're mild and slightly nutty in flavor, with a texture that ranges from crunchy to crisp to tender, depending on how you prepare them. They can be served raw, right out of the bag, with hummus or ranch for a satisfying snack, or they can be steamed, stir-fried, or sautéed, for a quick and easy side.

In fact, if there were such a rule, Trader Joe's BBQ & Black Pepper Toscano Chopped Salad would be the ultimate rule-breaker! This is a complete salad kit, containing everything you need to construct a crisp, fresh-and particularly bold- salad. The base includes green and red cabbages, combined with shredded carrots, broccoli, and kale. Such confident vegetable crunchiness is complemented by even more crunch, conveyed by cornbread croutons. The addition of aged, Black Pepper Toscano Cheese (packaged separately) brings another kind of boldness to this Salad-a rich and nutty flavor, with a touch of cracked black pepper heat. The final stroke of bold is delivered in the BBQ sweet onion dressing. Its molasses notes pair exceptionally well with the flavor of the Black Pepper Cheese, and the rest of the dressing profile (including mustard, white wine vinegar, onion, garlic, and chili powder) provides the finishing touch for this un-shy salad. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

We mean that quite literally- its complex mix of savory, salty, umami, and, in many varieties, sweet, simply demands to be remarked upon. What's even more remarkable is how well those complexly interwoven flavors interact with other flavors and textures, as is ably demonstrated in Trader Joe's Miso Crunch Chopped Salad Kit. Each bag contains a mix of shredded cabbage, kale, and carrots, to which our supplier adds a packet of crispy chow mein noodles, cashews, and sesame seeds, then ties it all together with a tangy, nutty, just-so-slightly caramel-y sesame miso dressing. While the flavors of miso may be curiously complex, putting together this summer-seasonal Salad Kit is exceedingly simple: all it takes on your end is to toss all ingredients together in a bowl until well mixed, and serve. Once ready, it can be enjoyed as a side salad, entrée, or base for a veggie bowl. We find it tends to play well off of proteins that already have a bit of sweetness or spice to them, like glazed chicken wings, grilled shrimp skewers, or Pork Gyoza [sku 10162] with plenty of Sriracha [sku 50828].

But our new Elote Chopped Salad Kit is packed with ingredients that evoke the flavors of this creamy, crunchy classic in every bite. Really. It begins with a mixed veggie base that includes chopped green & red cabbage, green leaf lettuce, carrots, kale, green onion, and of course, crispy, dried, sweet corn kernels. We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor and adds a soft texture to the mix. The real magic here lies in the creamy, elote-inspired dressing that's a little tart and a little sweet, with hints of jalapeño and lime. Tossed together, you won't think you're eating elote from a street vendor, but you will feel that same energy in every forkful of greens. Add your favorite protein (we like chicken or shrimp) and a sliced avocado to make this a complete meal. Grab a corn tortilla and heat it ever so slightly, then fill it with this satisfying mix-a taco to remember, for sure!

It's also extremely flexible in the kitchen. You can steam it, boil it, braise it, bake it, roast it, microwave it, stir-fry it, and even pickle it-not to mention shredding it, raw. Now through March 16, Trader Joe's Green Cabbage Heads are here to help you celebrate the healthfulness and culinary versatility of this cruciferous cabeza. How will you prepare it? Here's an inspirational headcount of the best cabbage cuisine from around the globe: Fermented cabbage is the basis for German Sauerkraut, as well as Korea's national dish, Kimchi. Russia's national dish is Golubtsy, which consists of cabbage rolls stuffed with beef and rice, simmered in tomato sauce. The Irish mash their beloved potatoes together with cabbage for Colcannon (traditionally served November 1st), while Irish-Americans pair cabbage with Corned Beef to honor St. Patrick. Dutch Koolsla (cabbage salad) has been variously adapted in the Americas. It's served alongside Fried Chicken in the U.S., atop Mexican Fish Tacos, and as a condiment for Salvadorian Papusas. Still, some are put off by the cole's \"stinky\" reputation. Let us get ahead of that bad PR: While it may be pun- gent when overcooked, cabbage is delicately nutty and sweet when cooked just enough. And when raw, cab- bage has a pleasant crunch with just a slight bitterness.

What they are used for-all around the world-is healthy, holiday fare. Butternut Squashes (as we call them) are pear-shaped, with a trunk-like top and bulbous bottoms. Their outer skin is tan, progressing to a deeper orange color as the fruit ripens. Inside, the flesh is bright orange. When cooked, Butternuts becomes tender and soft and have a nutty, moderately sweet flavor. If you know squashes, then you know that most varieties are very versatile when it comes to preparation. The Butternut is no exception. Enjoy it baked, steamed, sautéed, roasted, even micro-waved. With this particular squash's length, you might try grilling it, as is popular in South Africa. Slice it lengthwise, brush it with oil, sprinkle with some nutmeg and cinnamon, and put it cut side down on the grill. The interesting shape also makes for a nice presentation when stuffed and baked. Fill it with a green, like kale or spinach, and some cheese, like shaved Parmesan or crumbled feta. Last thing¿ though the name implies otherwise, we don't recommend spreading any of our Nut Butters on this Squash.

   "description": "We'd like to extol the many virtues of Trader Joe's Organic English Cucumbers. These are long, thin cucumbers with very few seeds and thin skins. Unlike most commercially cultivated cucumbers, these are not waxed, so you can eat the skin - you'll want to give them a quick wash, of course. Because of the scarcity of seeds, this variety is easier on the stomach and less bitter than other cucumbers - this has led some to call these \"burpless\" cukes. Really. Can't make this stuff up, folks. We get a lot of questions about why they're shrink-wrapped, and it's directly related to the 'cukes being \"not waxed.\" Once harvested, these Organic English Cucumbers have to travel to get to your neighborhood Trader Joe's, and their unwaxed nature leaves them vulnerable to the elements. The shrink-wrap keeps them safe, and ensures consistent quality when you get them home. Speaking of when you get them home, you can use Organic English Cucumbers anywhere you'd use any other type of cucumbers - in a salad, as a healthy snack, stuffed into a pita sandwich with hummus and tomatoes, blended with tomatoes into a cool, refreshing gazpacho, or double up the cukey goodness by dipping them in our Tzatziki Dip [sku 20405]. We're selling them for $2.49 each - a price that will leave you feeling cool as a cucumber. You'll find them in our fresh produce section.",

California- grown spinach is sautéed with onions and herbs and mixed into a creamy ricotta and feta cheese blend, then hand-folded into fillo dough triangles. When baked, the fillo becomes light and flaky and the flavors of the spinach, herbs and cheese marry. Even though each crisp/tender pastry triangle is loaded to the angles with robust cheesy filling, it isn't overly rich. In fact, the feta and ricotta deliver a tangy sourness that embraces the mineral-rich spinach. The result is an elegant finger food that's a hit with everyone who tries it.

Speaking of the filling, each triangle is packed corner-to-corner with a curry-like mixture of peas, carrots, potatoes, lentils, onions, and Indian spices. In fact, the filling is 50% of the recipe (versus about 35% in other brands). The vegetables are tender & mildly spicy, filling your mouth with warm flavors redolent of the Indian subcontinent.

There are a few theories as two why: some argue that it's a tendency for higher gluten content, some point to a mastery of fermentation techniques, others tie it to various intangible qualities of local ingredients. Whatever the cause, it's all academic unless you have the chance to visit France. But that got us thinking: why not bring France to our freezers? Thus, we bring to you Trader Joe's Mini French Baguettes, a collection of six compact, individual baguettes, made especially for us by a French bakery, which are baked to about 80% doneness, then frozen for you to finish at home.

Once fully cooked from your oven (simply place them directly on the oven rack, from frozen, at 400°F for about six minutes), these Baguettes can be enjoyed in any way you would if they came from a boulangerie on the banks of the Seine: cut them into hunks and enjoy with a bowl of soup, tear into pieces and dip into a flavorful olive oil, even split them horizontally for an elegantly elevated sandwich.

Across the country, the climate was largely inhospitable to domestic wheat cultivation, and what little was shipped in from Europe mostly ended up in the hands of wealthy European settlers. Enslaved Brazilians of African descent soon discovered that the locally-grown cassava root could be processed into a starch (which we now commonly call tapioca) and made into a delicious, airy, totally wheat-free bread. Years later, bakers added cheese, and the recipe flourished across the continent. But it's the original pao de queijo (as its known in Brazil) that's most famous throughout the world, and it's also what inspired Trader Joe's Brazilian Style Cheese Bread. Made with tapioca flour and parmesan cheese, our frozen, easy-to-bake Cheese Bread is a true delight: Crispy on the outside, light, airy, and chewy on the inside, with pockets of cheese to provide some extra flavor and texture. Pao de queijo is often eaten for breakfast in Brazil, but we find our Cheese Bread makes a great starter, side, or anytime snack.

We've always thought that this simple, savory-pie construction is one of its greatest strengths. Trader Joe's Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche definitely plays to this strength-but don't think for a minute that \"simple construction\" means anything less than delicious!

These Waffles are made with blueberry flavored bits, along with natural blueberry flavoring to deliver the utmost blueberry- on-blueberry experience. When toasted, they take on a wonderfully crisp exterior and chewy interior, much like waffles you'd make from scratch, at a fraction of the time. Looking for a new way to enjoy Blueberry Waffles? Try toasting them, then sandwiching a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883] in between. You could even drizzle that with Maple Syrup [sku 04892]. They're also great for a quick, handheld breakfast to-go or, if you have more time on your hands, they make an excellent companion next to Apple Smoked Bacon [sku 74911], and your favorite eggy creations.

And they're fully cooked, so all you have to do is reheat & eat! While we find that the air fryer is the quickest method (just 5 to 6 minutes), yielding the crispest exterior, our Potato Pancakes are equally yummy prepared in a skillet on the stovetop, or in a conventional oven. Latkes are, of course, a Hanukkah tradition, but they're not just for holidays. We enjoy our kosher-certified Potato Pancakes at breakfast, dinner or anytime in between. Give them a try as a side with your favorite delicatessen delicacy, or as the foundation for a fantastic smoked salmon Benedict.

   "description": "The Lorraine region in northeastern France is associated with numerous notable cuisines. Potato stew, smoked bacon, macarons, and madeleines all have roots of origin, or development in Lorraine-but what first comes to mind is their most famous dish, the quiche. While this region's namesake quiche contains bacon, we sought a meatless version-still hoping to convey the richness of flavor that comes with the original. To do so, we traveled to the source (of course!) and found French bakers with the traditional knowledge & skills needed to create Trader Joe's Mixed Mushrooms & Spinach Quiche. The crust is made with wheat flour and real butter. The savory custard center consists of eggs, crème fraiche, and Emmental Swiss, with chopped spinach, and a blend of White Button & Oyster mushrooms. Just the right amount of salt, and nutmeg (that not-so-secret, secret ingredient) help delicately balance all the flavors. The umami of the mushrooms, combined with the rich custard makes for a wonderfully satisfying meal (no bacon required)-and one with 12g of protein and just 420 calories per serving. (That's the entire 6.17-ounce Quiche!) Add a simple side salad of Champs Elysees greens [sku 26370], and a glass of Révélation Chardonnay [sku 97161], and you might as well be having lunch at a Metz café. It'll cost you much less, though.

   "description": "The origin of the French word quiche is unknown, but it kind of sounds like \"kiss,\" as in: \"Please give me a quiche.\" That's good enough for us. So, what would make a quiche worthy of such a comparison? In our opinion, the quiche would have to be so good it keeps you coming back for more. Trader Joe's Quiche Lorraine is exactly that good. While we already sell a frozen Broccoli and Cheddar Quiche, and a Spinach and Mushroom Quiche, we've yet to provide our customers with the classic from Lorraine, France. The reason for our delay has had to do with¿ ham. You see, Quiche Lorraine must not only have a perfectly flaky, savory, buttery crust-it must also have plenty of ham. The trouble is, most quality bakeries that can produce a high-quality pastry, are not USDA approved; which means, they can only include 3% ham, or less. Not good enough! After a diligent search, our developers finally found the right supplier in San Francisco. The Quiche Lorraine they make for us has a superb pastry crust, and contains about 20% uncured ham. The ham is matched with Swiss cheese, both of which are presented in a soft egg custard made from a short list of simple ingredients. The Quiche is fully cooked, so you need only heat it and serve, either hot or room temperature. Serve it for breakfast with fresh fruit, or for lunch with fresh greens. It feeds four, unless you cut it into smaller pieces and serve it as an hors d'oeuvre. So versatile! So quiche-able. If you find lips are starting to quiver, hurry to Trader Joe's. We'll gladly give you a quiche (Quiche Lorraine, that is), and that for only $5.49. 02.27. 17",

And while there's nothing wrong with waffles, pancakes, or croissants, we felt there was an opportunity to bring in some lower carb, higher protein offerings to round out the set. To fill this gap and bolster your breakfasts, we are excited to welcome Trader Joe's Egg Frittata with Swiss Cheese & Cauliflower to our frozen case! Made with a hearty base of 41% egg and 25% Swiss cheese, Trader Joe's Egg Frittata has a fluffy texture that belies its protein-packed ingredient list. Earthy cauliflower, fried onions, and the aforementioned cheese create the classic, belly-warming breakfast profile: craveably savory and utterly delicious. To amp up the protein content, our supplier uses egg whites, whole eggs, and whey protein concentrate-add it all up, and you get about 12 grams of protein and 15% of your daily calcium needs, at just 5 grams of carbs per fully-cooked Frittata! To achieve peak Frittata perfection, simply reheat in the microwave or bake to your heart's (and your schedule's) content. Its plump disc shape makes it just the right size for an egg sandwich on a TJ's British Muffin [sku 14626/90558], with a slice of Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923], Fully Cooked Bacon [sku 86483], and a squirt of Sriracha Sauce [sku 96923]. Or use two TJ's Hashbrowns [sku 96923] in place of the muffin for a crunchier, brunchier composition. On the other hand, if you're going for a lower carb concoction, set one of these Frittatas atop a bed of crisp salad greens dressed in vinaigrette, and you've got a satisfying meal on your hands, with hardly any fuss. Seek out similar Frittatas elsewhere, and you'll find that artificial ingredients abound. We're offering 4.94-ounce boxes of two Trader Joe's Egg Frittata with Swiss Cheese & Cauliflower for $2.99-a value that's sure to have you waking up on the right side of the bed.

They're typically made from a simple recipe of sweet, yeasted batter, but require a highly specialized skillet called a poffertjespan to attain their perfectly snackable, one-or-two-bite size. In the spirit of foodie festivity, and in recognition of the fact that most of us don't have a spare poffertjespan lying around, we proudly offer Trader Joe's Maple Flavored Poffertjes as an effortless option for breakfasts, brunches, or even just sweet, simply snacking. Light, puffy, and perfectly sized to pop in your mouth, our frozen Poffertjes are flavored with rich maple sugar to give each bite the feeling of a pancake covered in maple syrup, and take less than a minute to heat a serving in the microwave. Like the traditional Dutch treat they were inspired by, they can be topped with melted butter and a sprinkling of powdered sugar, or accompanied by your favorite fruit preserves (or even a quick drizzle of more maple syrup) to match your mood.

Of course, even the best designs can do with a bit of streamlining now and then. That's where Trader Joe's Eggwich Sandwich comes in. This ingenious twist on a classic formula starts with an old-fashioned base of turkey sausage topped with American cheese, but replaces the bread with two soft-yet-sturdy scrambled egg patties, creating a breakfast sandwich experience that's packed with protein, lighter on carbs, and has everything you need to start your day off on a decidedly delicious note. Each Eggwich comes fully cooked and ready to reheat from frozen, which only takes about two minutes in the microwave. Once heated through (and given a moment to cool), the cheese becomes marvelously melty, the turkey sausage takes on a crisp, yet yielding, texture, and the egg patties become fantastically fluffy, while still maintaining enough structure to act as handholds. If that weren't enough, every Eggwich is consciously crafted to contain a whopping sixteen grams of protein, but only three grams of carbohydrates.

That's why we're such big fans of Trader Joe's Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl. Made with an ingredient deck that's exclusively fruit, fruit juice, chia seeds, and water, each bowl starts with a base of tangy mango purée that's been mixed with coconut cream, passion fruit juice, and black chia seeds.

And now, we're delighted to keep the nearly millenium-long history of waffles going by welcoming Trader Joe's Whole Grain Waffles to our frozen waffle offerings.

It's versatile, delicious, and in the case of Trader Joe's New York Style Cheesecake, it couldn't be simpler - just thaw and serve. New York-style cheesecakes use a cream cheese base, also incorporating sour cream and a graham cracker crust. As a bonus, sour cream makes the cheesecake more resilient to completely freezing, that's why we can just thaw ours in 1-2 hours at room temperature. Its creamy, smooth consistency and rich traditional cheesecake flavor make it a winner no matter how you slice it - we recommend using a cake slicer, but, hey, whatever works for you. Serve it just as it is or pair it with warm strawberries, blueberries, and a dollop of whipped cream for an extra- special dessert treat. Each 30-ounce NY Deli Style Cheesecake is $6.99*.

But historically, bread pudding was primarily a way to avoid wasting stale bread - combine that stale loaf with some milk, sugar, and butter, and suddenly what would have been discarded has become something delightfully delicious. Comfort food, even. Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bread Pudding is a brilliant example of comfort food. With a thick, custard-like consistency and the certain flavor of pumpkin pie and all its warm, savory spices, Pumpkin Bread Pudding is a terrific dessert to have on hand for Pumpkin Season parties and gatherings. Because it's fully cooked, its preparation is simple - defrost and serve, or warm in the oven to enhance the flavors even further. We imagine the early iterations of bread pudding didn't have the benefit of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream - we highly recommend either (or both!) to provide the finishing touch here. Had early pudding provocateurs pondered pumpkin, they, too, would have utilized this sweet fruit in their frugal concoction. We're sure of it. We're also sure ours is a great value.

So, when the tide began to swell, we were well into a macaron renaissance here at Trader Joe's. To create authentic macarons, we turned to our partners in France, where macarons have been celebrated since that \"other\" Renaissance. This pâtisserie has famously mastered the macaronage technique. In fact, they've transformed it into a roboticized science. It's uncanny, really, how they've managed to fashion a treat that so marvelously mimics the hand-made experience. The airy and slightly crisp, slightly chewy, almond-and-egg-white-based meringue cookies have a mesmerizing bite. And their vibrant fillings, ranging from jam to buttercream, are sincerely satisfying. Trader Joe's A Dozen Macarons Variés features six vivacious flavors: Apricot, Coconut, Fig, Salted Caramel, Lemon, and Pistachio. With two Macarons of each flavor in a box, the assortment presents beautifully, resembling the appearance of a Macaron display in a Paris pâtisserie or a local, upscale bake shop. Unlike the macarons you'd find in either of those two places, however, A Dozen Macarons Variés are crafted using colors derived exclusively from natural sources, without artificial flavoring, and are about three times less expensive-$4.99 for a 4.2-ounce box of 12 Macarons.

While we can appreciate a healthy dose of realism here and there, we'd like to challenge these Negative Nancies: why can't life always be peaches & cream, hmm? As long as you have a stack of Trader Joe's Peaches & Cream Tartes in your freezer, we say it can be. To craft our Peaches & Cream Tarte, we take a buttery, flaky crust, spread a layer of sweet cream cheese on top, fill it with sugared peaches, and carefully fold in its edges. This Tarte-building is all done by hand, so it's free-form and unrefined-just how we like it. We bake each Tarte to sunny perfection-glistening orange in the center; golden brown at the edges-so that by the time it makes its way to you, all you have to do is heat it up. Unlike some frozen, fully-baked desserts, you can warm our Peaches & Cream Tarte in the oven or the microwave-just follow the instructions on the package. We recommend keeping a Peaches & Cream Tarte or two in your freezer at all times so that you're never caught unprepared for unexpected dinner guests, impromptu tea parties, and/or last-minute potlucks. Serve each warm slice with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576], and your dining companions will surely be wowed. A Tarte like this would easily sell for $11.99 and up in a fine pâtisserie. Lucky for you, we have such a great relationship with our Canadian supplier that we are able to offer each 16.9-ounce Peaches & Cream Tarte (that's over a pound of sweet, peachy goodness!) for $4.99.

In fact, those chocolate-covered banana slices are one of our best-selling frozen treats of all time, which got us thinking: what other frozen fruit frontiers can we explore? What other tropical treats could be lying in wait, yearning to be covered in candy? The answer, it turns out, took us down to the strawberry fields of North- ern Thailand, where we found our next gastronomic goody to go ga-ga for: Trader Joe's Gone Berry Crazy Chocolate Covered Strawberry Slices. Though the concept is simple, the results are decadent: juicy, delicious Thai strawberries are sliced in half and enrobed in luxuriously dark chocolate, then flash frozen. No preparation required - in fact, we discourage you from even letting them defrost too much, lest you miss out on their snappy, snackable texture. Simply open the box and enjoy as many slices as you care to - which, of course, may or may not end up being the whole box. While we're sure you'll flip your lid for these strawberries on their own, they also make great company for other desserts. We recommend dropping a few onto a sundae, or using them as delectable decorations on top of an ice cream cake. And we can't overlook their appeal as a quick dessert solution for an impromptu romantic date, especially when paired with a glass of Cecilia Beretta Spumante Rose [sku 59097].

But when our original supplier informed us they could no longer produce those Bars, we took it as an opportunity for a real kaizen. We reached out to another of our trusted suppliers and asked if they could make us a version that had all the same zesty, sweet, and tart flavors, the same soft, buttery-textured shortbread and silky, smooth lemon layer - but none of the gelatin that left the last version inaccessible to vegetarians. They came back with a tray of lemon bars so superbly true to form that we knew they were going to be an instant classic. Fittingly enough, we decided to call them Trader Joe's 12 Classic Lemon Bars. Our favorite thing about these Bars is their bite. The delicate texture of the soft, creamy lemon layer instantly gives way to the dense, deliciously crumbly shortbread base, giving you all the satisfaction of a sweet custard and a rich, buttery biscuit all at the same time. Of course, we also love that they're super easy to prepare; simply defrost them at room temperature for about an hour before serving. And we can't forget that they're a remarkable value, too: each 10.6-ounce box sells for $4.49*, every day.

Simultaneously sweet, refreshing, and texturally satisfying, a typical sip of a boba drink starts with the cool rush of iced, sweetened, and often fabulously flavored milk (or a comparable non-dairy beverage) and ends on a delightfully chewy note, courtesy of the tapioca pearls (A.K.A. boba) that mingle at the bottom of the cup. It's a taste-texture combo that serves as an ideal anytime treat, especially when combined with a savory snack. And now, thanks to Trader Joe's Instant Boba Kit, it can be enjoyed from the comforts of your very own home. For right about the same price you'd pay for a single boba drink at a café, each Boba Kit contains four pouches of tapioca pearls flavored with rich brown sugar, which take only a minute in the microwave to heat up. From there, it's just a matter of mixing into a glass of your preferred milk or non-dairy alternative, adding ice, and enjoying. Why, we've even included a wide-gauge paper straw to go along with each pouch to make sure you can capture a few boba with every sip.

It's the same great recipe it's always been, using real butter that you can taste.

And it couldn't be easier. Just take a crust out of the box, let it thaw, roll it out into a pie plate, fill and bake. It's larger than the average supermarket pie crust-you can either make a bigger pie or trim and use the excess for decorating-a quickly cut \"leaf \" or \"apple\" looks pretty darn impressive atop your pie.

   "description": "Since Trader Joe's Customers love our shrimp offerings-and our other seafood \"burgers\" are popular-we thought it was about time to create Trader Joe's Shrimp Seafood Burgers. Generally speaking, \"burgers\" made from shrimp are unique. We've only seen them in restaurants. Ours are made of 70% farm-raised, Pacific White Shrimp and 23% wild-caught Pollock, held together with rice flour and sunflower oil. They are seasoned with garlic powder, dried basil, salt, and black pepper, which makes for juicy and delicious Seafood Burgers-whether you grill, bake, or pan fry them. And each one of these 90 calorie patties (there are 4 per box) delivers 13g of protein. That's not shrimpy! We're selling each 12.8-ounce box of Shrimp Seafood Burgers for $6.99.* Find them in our freezers. *Prices may change. Please check QIL to confirm most up-to-date price before creating signage.

You're probably wearing a Hawaiian shirt sitting on a beach chair surrounded by coconuts, pineapples, and lovely waters. A one-way ticket to Trader Joe's, for a lot less cash, will bring you a little closer to that vacation experience in the form of Trader Joe's Coconut Shrimp. We use large, peeled shrimp lightly breaded and coated with organic coconut shreds, the signature of a tropical vacation. (unlike most commercially available coconut, the organic coconut here has not been bleached). The recipe includes a touch of sugar for sweetness and a bit of pineapple flavor for tartness. Serve them with Seafood Cocktail Sauce [sku 18757] or Tartar Sauce [sku 38108] for dipping. They can be presented on a platter at a casual gathering or passed among your guests as hors d'oeuvres at a more formal occasion. For crispiest results, bake in a 450 degree conventional oven for about ten minutes.

   "description": "The Portuguese introduced tempura to Japan nearly 400 years ago. Unfortunately, there was a shortage in oil production when it was introduced. Since tempura relies heavily on oil, it was initially offered as just a snack. It wasn't until the Meji period (1868-1912) when oil production increased that tempura became more prominent in Japanese culture and cuisine. Trader Joe's Tempura Shrimp is our contribution to the history of tempura. The elongated Shrimp are peeled, properly cleaned, and generously coated with tempura batter consisting of water, flour, and tapioca starch. The Tempura Shrimp is then fried to help create a crispy, flaky profile. And, it even comes with a delicious Soy Dipping Sauce. Add this Shrimp to a basket of other battered Trader Joe's fish with a round of dipping sauces to create a fun meal your family will love!

Thankfully, a properly prepared frozen salmon fillet can be just as enjoyable to eat. We currently stock a couple different varieties from the Pacific in our freezers, and now we're adding one from a different ocean to our selection: Farm Raised Atlantic Salmon Fillets. This Atlantic Salmon is Farm Raised in the icy cold, pristine waters off the coast of Northern Norway. It's deboned and quick-frozen shortly after being harvested to provide the \"freshest\" frozen fish possible. The skin is left on, which is convenient if you want to grill it. Each, approximately four-ounce, Fillet possesses medium- firm flesh with large flakes and a mild flavor. That means our frozen Atlantic Salmon is excellent just about any way you want to prepare it: grilled, baked, broiled, or fried. See package for helpful prep instructions.

   "description": "Branzino (aka European Sea Bass) is a popular fish in Italy and other Mediterranean countries, in part, because it is so plentiful in the Mediterranean Sea. But its popularity may be due, even more so, to its character as a light, flaky, and sweet, white fish. Trader Joe's Branzino Fillets make European Sea Bass easily accessible. Our Fillets are farm-raised in Turkey-a method that helps prevent over-fishing of this popular progeny of Poseidon. Our one-pound freezer pack contains four fillets that have been deboned-a convenient format you're not likely to find elsewhere. The skin, however, is left on because this fish is traditionally prepared whole. With the application of olive oil and proper cooking, the delicate skin becomes pleasantly crisp; a nice contrast to the flaky fish. Speaking of prep, you can either thaw these Branzino Fillets overnight in the fridge, or more quickly in a sealed bag placed in a bowl of cold water on the counter for 30 minutes. Once thawed, you have numerous cooking options, including: baking, broiling, grilling (wrapped in foil), or pan frying.

Knowing how much our customers love Trader Joe's Wild Uncooked Argentinian Red Shrimp [sku 71696], we decided to start there, then spice it up-quite literally! These Red Shrimp are wild caught in the icy cold waters off the coast of Argentina. This variety is red even before it's cooked and known for its lobster-like qualities-such as a sweet- sea taste, and a meaty texture. We add ginger-garlic butter that has a hint of honey, along with some spiciness from chili flakes and cayenne. Then we bump the heat up another notch with a Togarashi Style Seasoning. In Japanese, Togarashi literally refers to the genus Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapenos, etc. Our particular blend has a chili powder base with orange peel, black & white sesame seeds, poppy seeds, szechuan pepper, and nori seaweed.

   "description": "Have you ever wondered why salmon and citrus seem to go so perfectly hand in hand? We certainly have, and as it turns out, there's a few reasons why. Part of it has to do with amines, the naturally occuring chemicals in fish meat responsible for what we call that \"fishy\" smell. When those make contact with an acid, like lemon juice, it causes a chemical reaction that converts them to amine salts, which have no smell, thus neutralizing any \"fishy\" aromas. In a relatively fatty fish like salmon, that citric acid also cuts through the fat and help the other flavors sing. Which is precisely why we've paired beautifully center-cut filets of Atlantic salmon with pre- prepped pats of lemon and herb butter in Trader Joe's Atlantic Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter, to show that all this technical talk isn't just theoretical - it's downright delicious. Uncommonly convenient and quick-cooking, each boneless filet takes just 10-15 minutes in the oven at 400°F to go from thawed to flawlessly flaky and flavorful. As the filet cooks, the Lemon Herb Butter melts over the Salmon, infusing it with flavors of zesty citrus, aromatic herbs, and - lest we forget - rich, creamy butter, which also serves to help crisp up the skin underneath. All in all, it creates an exceptionally tasty protein that can easily become a full-fledged meal with the simple addition of some rice, roasted veggies, or a salad. And top of all that, each seven-ounce filet of Atlantic Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter sells for the stellar retail of $4.99*.

Biologically, they're actually more closely related to crabs than either of those two, but culinarily, they taste something like a cross between all three. Our wild caught Langostino Tails, for instance, have a light, slightly buttery taste, reminiscent of both lobster tail and crab claw meat, and a soft texture that's similar to sautéed shrimp. But enough about their similarities to other shellfish, here's what makes them stand out on their own: these delightfully savory seafood morsels are practically made for throwing into rich pastas and bisques, as their natural butteriness is particularly fit for playing off of smooth and creamy textures.

   "description": "The Açaí trend shows no signs of slowing down - and why should it? Its complex, rich-tart berry flavor, with subtle hints of cacao, is refreshingly irresistible. As people look to eat healthier on the go, cafes and juiceries have devoted entire sections of their menus to energizing smoothies and filling breakfast bowls made with this brilliant berry of the Amazon. These menu offerings, however, are often packed with sugar, and always expensive. So we set out to find an appetizing yet affordable option for açaí, and came up with our Unsweetened Organic Açaí Purée Packets. Each package contains four convenient, single-serve packets of Unsweetened Organic Açaí Purée. You can add one to a smoothie or blend with Greek yogurt. Boost your post-workout hydration and mix a packet with coconut water. Blend a packet with banana and coconut milk to create a creamy base for an açaí bowl and add whatever toppings your heart desires - berries and granola, peaches and toasted flax, pumpkin seeds and coconut chips - you're only limited by your imagination (and seasonal topping availability, of course). Other açaí purée packets out in the market (some of which are sweetened!) sell for a whopping $5.99 and up. We're selling four-3.52 oz. packets of Unsweetened Organic Açaí Purée for $4.49, everyday. For a hearty açaí bowl: Run one frozen açaí packet under running water for five seconds to thaw and break into pieces. Tear the corner of the packet and squeeze contents into blender, along with sliced banana and coconut milk. Blend until desired consistency is reached (you want the mixture thick enough to be scoopable, but not so thick that it gets stuck in your blender). Pour mixture into a bowl and top with sliced berries and coconut cranberry granola. Add a drizzle of honey and almond butter for nutty sweetness, if desired. 10.10. 16",

The Boreal (also called Boréalie) is a collection of protected lands across Canada, united by an effort to preserve the beauty and ecology of the land.

We're in favor of any health benefits they might provide, but honestly, we're most concerned with how they taste.

From there, Chow Mein's popularity flourished around the globe, as each new region that it spread to began adapting it for their own local tastes. Trader Joe's Chicken Chow Mein, for instance, is about as classic an example of the American Chinese cuisine version as you can get: nice, soft wheat noodles, firm chunks of colorful and crispy veggies, and tender cuts of chicken breast, all covered in a savory, seasoned soy sauce. With just a few minutes of prep, Trader Joe's Chicken Chow Mein provides all the familiar, fun flavor of takeout Chow Mein at a fraction of the price. And since each 20 ounce bag creates three servings, the value goes even further.

When faced with the fact that we would be out of stock on this perennial favorite for a longish period of time, we took the opportunity to make some minor improvements that we think made a major impact on the quality and flavor of the product. So while we didn't want it to be out of stock, we do think it was worth the wait. Be it the English, Scottish, Irish or American version, Shepherd's Pie always consists of some kind of meat, vegetables and a crust of savory mashed potatoes. Though it dates back at least 150 years, there is much argument as to the origins of this dish. There's no arguing, though, that it's the ultimate comfort food. Our version lives up to that standard. Inside, beef, corn, peas, carrots, and green beans are combined with a savory gravy. On top, creamy mashed potatoes (way creamier than the previous incarnation). One of our favorite things about the previous version of this product was its nutritional profile. We're pleased to report that even with all the improvements we were able to make, Trader Joe's Shepherd's Pie still comes in at a mere 170 calories per serving (2 servings per container), with only three grams of fat. When you taste it, you'll really understand just how impressive this is. Also impressive? The price. We're selling each 16 ounce package of Shepherd's Pie for $4.49. Such a deal!

What we know for sure is that the modern, short-grain rice varieties that are now so directly associated with risotto weren't developed until the early 20th century. Of course, none of this is terribly surprising, as the evolution of food is one of our absolute favorite subjects. When we set out to develop an Asparagus Risotto, we went straight to the country with which this dish is most closely associated - Italy. Our supplier uses short grain rice and vibrantly green cuts of asparagus, along with cream, butter, and hard Italian cheese. This is an indulgent-tasting entrée, for sure, but the nutrition profile isn't quite as indulgent as you might expect - you can thank the inherent creaminess of the short grain rice for that!

Trader Joe's Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings is based on a traditional South Asian recipe that's been celebrated in the Indian region for five centuries. And, it's made with ingredients that have been enjoyed for thousands of years! Traditional Biryani is Basmati rice, steamed separately and layered with vegetables and/or meat that have been pan-fried with an intricate blend of aromatic, dry spices.

Our Biryani is 100% vegetarian, including the tender \"kofta\" or dumplings, which provide a textural contrast to the firm rice and veggies. As is customary, we've thrown in some sweet raisins and sliced cashews. This diverse blend of traditional ingredients yields an exciting exploration into the flavors and textures of South Asia.

As it happens, we love them, too! A few years ago we introduced our own versions of some of our favorites, and they proved to be smashing success stories. Until, that is, we had to find a new supplier to make them for us. This search led to a savory pie \"drought,\" and it was a very sad time indeed. Thankfully, that drought has passed, and we've once again entered a time of abundance, with the now-available Trader Joe's Steak & Stout Pie. Like their predecessors, these are individually sized pies made with all butter pastry that's filled with hearty chunks of tender beef in a stout-based gravy that's seasoned with traditional herbs and spices. The beef is joined by generous amounts of gold potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, and mushrooms. Like we said, this is comfort food at its most comforting. The Pies are fully cooked and frozen; they bake up to a golden brown, and the flavors are warm, savory, and satisfying. Add a simple green salad and dinner is served.

Trader Joe's carries a few different versions of Tikka Masala, including Paneer Tikka Masala [sku 99143], and Chicken Tikka Masala [sku 98912]. But, while our pieces of chicken or cheese cooked in Indian curry may keep carnivores and vegetarians grinning, the vegan who craves Indian food has had little reason to smile¿ until now¿ Determined not to discriminate against discriminating palates of any determination, we cooked up Trader Joe's Vegan Tikka Masala. (Truthfully, it's probably less about the need to curb any kind of vegan discrimination, and more about the earnest desire to share our delicious Masala with all.) One of our Indian suppliers, located in New Jersey, has been making Trader Joe's Masala for years. The difference this time is that they've used soy protein in place of chicken or cheese. This \"meatless meat\" (developed by a Taiwanese supplier), comes so close to lamb in its texture, you may find it hard to tell the difference. It's bathed in a spicy (but not too hot), tomato and coconut-milk sauce that is expertly flavored with onions, garlic, cashews, and spices, and presented on a bed of cumin-flavored Basmati rice. Just heat (in the microwave or conventional oven) and eat (in your mouth). We believe this 9.5-ounce vegan entrée is an incredible value at $3.49-proving once again that the only two things against which Trader Joe's will ever discriminate are: low quality and high prices.

Trader Joe's lays claim to Gnocchi al Gorgonzola, which marries these beautiful creations to make an inviting, delicious dish. Gnocchi al Gorgonzola is easy to prepare on the stovetop or in the microwave, and is ready in about 7 minutes. Let's take a minute to appreciate that incredible ease of preparation for what might otherwise be a rather involved dish-one minute later-wow, right? We enjoy Gnocchi al Gorgonzola served simply, with a couple cracks of black pepper over the top. We also enjoy embellishing it with cherry tomatoes and broccoli florets or crumbled walnuts.

   "description": "It's disconcerting that at any given moment, bombs are going off somewhere in the world. Fortunately, not all bombs are destructive. Modern chefs have created umami bombs. Umami-oo-MA-mee-is the \"fifth taste\" (after sweet, salty, sour, and bitter...), and it's been used for ages, though not officially identified until the early twentieth century. When dropped in the mouth, umami bombs detonate comforting, savory flavors. Trader Ming's Shiitake Mushroom Chicken is our latest comestible bomb, and it's been artfully calibrated to bring peace to your palate. Chunks of soy-sauce marinated, dark-meat chicken combine with Shiitake mushrooms, edamame (soy beans), and green beans. It's all sautéed (during heating) in a ginger soy sauce. Chicken, mushrooms, and soy-each one rich in glutamates-explode with umami, devastating your tongue with nuclear pleasure. That's a good thing. Even more \"devastating,\" is the simple prep. Sauce and veggies come frozen in two separate packets; the chicken, loose in the larger package. Defrost the sauce packet in a bowl of hot water while you thaw the chicken and veggies for two to three minutes in the microwave. With a spot of cooking oil, sauté it all together in a large fry pan or wok for five to six minutes and you'll have a satisfying meal to keep the peace among hungry family- members. Serve it with Trader Joe's frozen, fully cooked Organic Brown Rice [sku 53036]. Everyone knows that food brings people together. While it may seem unlikely that real bombs will cease anytime soon, we like to imagine that if worldwide harmony were to breakout, Trader Ming's Shiitake Mushroom Chicken would be the perfect bomb to drop at the peace potluck. Add this 22-ounce umami bomb to your dinner arsenal for only $4.99. Find it in our freezers. 3.19.1 5",

   "description": "You might say Greeks know how to eat. The tragic poet Euripides, who lived almost 500 years before Christ, said: \"When a man's stomach is full it makes no difference whether he is rich or poor.\" While this philosophy has undoubtedly led to Greece's modern-day financial woes, there is also little doubt it has led to some of history's greatest tastes. Traveling the Balkan Peninsula in recent months, we've explored the culinary landscape to discover some landmark foods that aren't readily available elsewhere. Trader Joe's 5 Cheese Greek Spiral is an item we've developed there based on a savory pie from the region of Kozani. The Kichi Kozani is a long, thin filo pastry that's been stuffed with cheese and coiled to resemble a snail's shell or gathered length of rope. This pie's filling is traditionally a blend of feta and some kind of harder cheese. We don't presume to improve upon cultural food traditions as rich and deep as that of Greece¿ but then again, we are Trader Joe's. Going with our gut, we wanted more kinds of cheese for more-cheesy flavor. We settled on a blend of five: gouda, kasseri, kefalotyri, semi-hard cheese, and blue cheese. This combination of cow's-, sheep's-, and goat's-milk cheeses wrapped in filo is baked (by you) in a 375ºF oven until golden-crisp on top and melty-good inside. Made for us near Thessaloniki (not too far from where the Kichi Kozani originates) our fourteen-ounce, 5 Cheese Greek Spiral is now as close to you as the Trader Joe's freezer case. It's also conveniently priced at $3.99 so no man (or woman) will have to go into debt to fill his stomach with this pleasing pie. 6.10.1 5",

   "description": "In 2011 we introduced Trader Ming's Szechuan Style Spicy Beef & Broccoli [sku 95000]. To create our own ver- sion of the famous Southwestern Chinese dish, we brought together tender strips of beef and lightly blanched broccoli florets, mixing them together in a traditional sauce flavored by red chile garlic puree, soy sauce, vinegar, more garlic, ginger, more red chilies (crushed), and cayenne pepper. Four years later, we're reintroducing this dish as Trader Ming's Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef & Broccoli. The difference? We took a hard look at the recipe and realized we could significantly reduce the amount of salt and sugar without compromising the great flavor. We brought the sodium down from the whopping 1390 mg that is was (!) to a mere 630 mg. That's a 55% reduction in sodium. We also significantly reduced the sugar, taking it down from 52 g to 27 g-a 48% reduction. Everything else is nearly identical¿ the wonderful contrast of the tender beef; the subtle crunch of the broccoli; the zesty zing of the chile-garlic sauce; and the overall balance of mild sweetness with just a little bit of heat. Serve it with our Fully Cooked Brown Rice [sku 77409] and it can satisfy up to three hungry people. Get creative and wrap it in a tortilla for a spicy-sweet burrito, or serve it on a bed of greens for a unique salad. The sauce, the broccoli, and the beef are still packaged separately to maintain their integrity, and the entire meal can be ready in about ten minutes. Our \"new\" Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef & Broccoli with lower sodium, and less sugar is just $6.99. Find it in our freezers! 9.01.1 5",

   "description": "Soup goes in a bowl or in a cup-unless, of course, you are a fan of Xiao Long Bao. Then, your soup goes in a dumpling. Trader Joe's Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of Chinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile. This concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms their wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each dumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth-broth made from ingredients includ- ing chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means \"wrapped\" in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you. To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful! We suggest placing a hot Soup Dumpling on a deep Chinese soup spoon and nibbling a little hole in the side to let the soup run out before enjoying soup and dumpling together. You get six large Chicken Soup Dumplings in each six ounce package for $2.99. With Trader Joe's, the soup's not only on-it's IN! ¿ in our Dumplings and in our freezers, everyday. 10.14. 15",

Following this unimpeachable logic, Trader Joe's Sriracha Seafood Potstickers with Shrimp & Crab are sure to amplify your holiday happiness. Our supplier in Thailand handcrafts these delicate dumplings using wrappers that have been colored with beet juice and spinach, so the red and green hues are rich and deep to complement the flavors within.

Following in the recent footsteps of our 5 Cheese Greek Spiral [sku 54073], and our Tomato Tiropita Triangles [sku 54481], our latest pita is a traditional \"pie\" you may have heard of, even if you've never traveled to Greece. But, we did travel to Greece for this Spana- kopita, where we engaged some Athenian bakers to make this authentic Greek pastry for us (and for you). It's essentially a spinach pie... but the genius is in the details. Our Greek pie-makers start with their own filo dough, machine-cut to size and hand assembled into pies with a filling of three cheeses (feta, mizithra, and a grating cheese), spinach, onion, leek, olive oil, dill, parsley, salt and pepper. The loaded disc is then pre-cut into wedges that will puff up when you bake them at home. Once you do bake this pie (in the provided ovenable tray at 350ºF for about a half-hour), you'll have yourself a crisp, buttery pastry with a delectable filling. Our Spanakopita makes a great snack anytime, and it can also serve as a light meal when paired with a fresh sal- ad of tomatoes, olives, and greens, and lightly dressed with 100% Greek Olive Oil and Lemon Juice [sku 54483]). We would still recommend you visit Greece, but if it's going to be a while, we would also suggest you visit Trader Joe's (much nearer) for a taste of our Greek Spanakopita to get you in the mood.

   "description": "When your fingers first pinch the outside wrapper of a spring roll, the texture is the tell. Soggy sides foreshadow watered-down filling. Crisp sides-that crackle with your touch-hold the promise of a big, balanced, boastful bite. Chasing down this crispy-fried-roll dim sum ideal, we partnered with Asian cuisine experts (who immigrated to New York from Taiwan to pursue their passion for food) to create Trader Joe's Chicken Spring Rolls. Having perfected the technique of eliminating excess water in their fillings, the wrappers on their rolls (now ours) stay exceptionally crisp. Lest you think we exaggerate, they've quantified the amount of moisture- between 35% to 40%-that they manage to extract from the vegetables. Even more important than the well-managed moisture are the vibrant flavors expressed in the hearty filling. Based on the popular Taiwanese \"3 Cup Chicken\" dish, our Chicken Spring Rolls feature chunks of white meat chicken, cabbage, carrots, and green onion that are cooked in hot woks with plentiful basil, garlic, and ginger. Simmered with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, and chili paste, the flavor only intensifies. The finished filling is carefully tucked into a wheat flour wrapper and deep-fried to make a thin, light, crisp shell. Bake in the oven (20-25 minutes), or fry on the stove top (5-10 minutes) until the outside wrapper is golden and tellingly crispy. Serve with our Sweet Chili Sauce [sku 91113] or Satay Peanut Sauce [sku 91369] for dipping. We're selling each nine ounce package of five Chicken Spring Rolls for $3.99. 04.18. 16",

   "description": "While dining at a famous New England seafood restaurant, one of the leaders of our buying team ordered an appetizer that was so good, she took a photo and sent it to the head of our frozen food category with the request to develop a Trader Joe's version. Over the next several weeks, two more leaders independently discovered the same appetizer and made the same request. As if by some unseen food-force, our course was set! Which dish made such an impression? It was essentially battered and fried cauliflower florets in a spicy and sweet sauce. Now, months later, we're excited to introduce Trader Ming's Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower; an item we expect many more people will be enjoying and sharing with others in the months to come. We found a Southern California vendor who agreed to pursue the development with us. They flew to the East Coast to experience the dish themselves, and even brought back samples for testing. As it often goes with these things, the road to product perfection was long and arduous. It was a challenge to get the batter to cook up crispy, due to the moisture released from the frozen cauliflower during baking. It was also a challenge to get the sauce right-spicy, but not too much heat, balanced with just the right amount of sweetness. Even so, hard work and perseverance led to our success! Trader Ming's Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower has all the best qualities of the original version, with the added bonus that you can enjoy it at home. We're selling each 24 ounce bag of Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower for $4.99. That's about six cups of cauli- flower-much more than you'd get for that price if you ordered it in that New England seafood restaurant. 03.21. 16",

   "description": "The original paella, known as paella valenciana, is an age-old, one-pan dish that traditionally includes rabbit (or chicken) and snails, cooked together with beans (three kinds), and saffron-seasoned, white rice. Over time, this one-pan dish has evolved to include a variety of different ingredients. Probably the most popular version worldwide (and the second most popular in Spain) is paella de marisco, after which we've patterned Trader Joe's Seafood Paella. Though not Valencian (or Spanish), our supplier isn't far from paella's origins. They are located about 1,400 miles away, on the northwestern coast of France-perfectly positioned for assembling Seafood Paella. We took advantage of their ocean expertise, loading up this Paella with 32% Seafood, including shrimp, calamari rings, and mussels. In place of beans, we include peas, fried onions, and a trio of peppers-red, yellow, and green. The seafood and veggies are nestled into sunny-yellow, short-grain, white rice that derives its color from naturally available ingredients (namely turmeric and saffron). All the flavors are woven together by our very own paella spice mix, which includes paprika, saffron, garlic, onion, and chili pepper. There's a lot of preparation that goes into making paella from scratch, but thankfully, with our Seafood Paella, you barely have to move a mussel (or shrimp or squid). Just empty the contents of the 16 ounce freezer bag into a large pan and stir gently until the shrimp is opaque and the rice is warmed through. You'll save hours of stirring with Trader Joe's Seafood Paella; and at $4.99, you'll also save on clams. 03.07. 16",

You can walk with a spring in your step or enjoy springtime weather. Or, a brilliant idea can spring from your mind. For us, this brilliant idea that sprung forth resulted in Trader Joe's Vegetable Spring Rolls. Named after the Spring Festival in China, where spring rolls are served, these are no ordinary Spring Rolls. While we've kept many of the elements found in traditional spring rolls, like cabbage, onion, and carrots, we've also cooked up some delightful updates. Kale, shredded tofu, and edamame add fresh and vibrant flavors to our rolls. All of these ingredients, along with mushrooms, ginger, and garlic, are put through a centrifuge to remove excess moisture and provide a crispier final product. Then this filling is rolled into a thin pastry wrapper and fried before frozen. Prepare according to the package directions and you'll have perfectly crispy, tasty Spring Rolls-as if they were never frozen! The best part about our Vegetable Spring Rolls (besides their tastiness, of course)¿? You can eat them year round! Cut rolls in half and serve at a cocktail party with Sweet Chili Sauce [sku 91113].

To borrow a wine making term, the terroir (or total natural environs) of southwestern New Mexico is what makes Hatch Chiles so special. When roasted with care, they are earthy, sweet, and spicy (ranging from mild to medium heat) with an alluring smokiness. Mac & Cheese, another American favorite, is beloved not so much for its terroir (after all, it is made all over the place!), but more for its concept. Who wouldn't love pasta doused in a rich, creamy, cheese sauce? It wasn't a big leap, then, to marry these two foods together, and Trader Joe's Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese proves it's a match made in Heaven (that most coveted, if only metaphorical, terroir). We coat semolina elbow macaroni in a rich, creamy, cheese sauce made from aged Cheddar, milk, and butter. Then, we notch it up with authentic Hatch Chiles, roasted, chopped, and mixed in for a welcoming, smoky-heat. For a satisfying full meal, heat our Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese from frozen in the ovenable tray, in either the microwave or conventional oven (directions on the package).

There just wouldn't be time. But when everything is measured and mixed and portioned ahead of time, those \"complicated\" meals suddenly become a whole lot more approach- able. So the next time you're craving walnut shrimp, don't try to find the time to create it from scratch or call for takeout, check out Trader Joe's Honey Walnut Shrimp in our freezer case. Inspired by numerous restaurant versions of this dish, we set out to create an easy-to-make iteration you could have on the table in less time than it would take to have it delivered. What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.) Speaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results. It's not at all complicated, really - sauté or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts. You can serve with rice or noodles or oodles of veggies. It's an easy dish you can put together in a snap, leaving you with more energy to deal with life's complications outside the kitchen.

Goan curries are famous for their bold, savory flavors and scorching spice levels, and Goa's arguably most famous export, vindaloo, is chief among them. Fiery hot vindaloo was the inspiration behind our frozen Lamb Vindaloo [sku 95432], and once again serves as inspiration for Trader Joe's Fiery Chicken Curry, a delightfully spicy tribute to Goa's delightfully spicy specialty.

On its own, the curry is a treat for the senses, especially for those of us with predilections for spice: the tomato and coconut base along with the chicken provide a remarkable, verging-on-sweet counterbalance to the heat of the chilies, while the garlic and other savory flavors build as you eat, creating a complex, earthy flavor profile that complements the heat perfectly.

If you've been enjoying our ongoing experimentations with this brassica-we've riced it, mashed it, grilled it, and put it into patties & pizza crusts-our latest adaptation is likely to gnoc your socks off¿ Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi (NYOK-kee) is made for us in Italy, and it's quite like those traditional Ital- ian dumplings made of mashed potato, flour, and egg-hence, the Gnocchi designation. This version, however, is made with about 75% cauliflower, as well as cassava flour, potato starch, extra virgin olive oil, and sea salt. No wheat, dairy, or eggs are included here, and that translates to fewer carbs, with significantly less fat & calories than potato-based varieties. Our Italian supplier, who specializes in regular gnocchi, uses the cauliflower they've grown in their own fields to create soft-textured bites that are easy to prepare. Sauté and crisp-up in a stovetop pan-our favorite prep method that requires no thawing and results in crisp, never-overcooked Gnocchi. You can alternatively boil or microwave them for a more tender presentation. And like other gnocchi you've known, these are tasty tossed in butter, fresh sage, and Shaved Parmesan Reggiano [sku 83140]. Or, if you prefer, Rustico Pomodoro Pasta Sauce [sku 72008] and fresh basil. Any way is a good way to dress up our Cauliflower Gnocchi.

   "description": "Inspired by the vibrant, lively flavors of Cubano cuisine, Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrus Garlic Bowl is our take on the classic comfort food dish, arroz con pollo. Each Bowl is filled with a mix of bright yellow rice (courtesy of a hearty application of turmeric), diced red bell peppers and onions, black beans, chunks of sweet plantains, and cilantro, which is then topped with chopped, juicy, marinated chicken thigh and a superbly savory citrus-and-garlic infused mojo criollo sauce. On its own, this would be a super hearty, profoundly delicious treat, but the addition of the mojo (a catchall in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine to describe sauces made from peppers, olive oil, and citrus juice) sauce totally kicks it into another gear, with pronounced notes of garlic, ginger, and orange zest. ¡Que rica!

It consistently ranks in the very top tier of our annual Customer's Choice Awards, it inspires odes and articles from fans across the internet - if we had a Product Hall of Fame, there's no question that it would be one of the first inductees. It's even a hit among our Crew. In fact, based on a Crew Member's suggestion, we began exploring the idea of a rice Bowl that featured our Mandarin Orange Chicken. After a few months of experimentation, we finally got the tastes and texture just right, and Trader Joe's Mandarin Style Orange Chicken Bowl was born. Made for us by the very same supplier as our original Orange Chicken, each 13 ounce Bowl features five ounces of tender, battered chicken leg meat, fried to perfection. That chicken is placed atop a hearty bed of savory, seasoned, fried rice, mixed with a medley of chopped veggies including carrots, broccoli, shallots, peas, and crunchy water chestnuts. When mixed together with the included packet of orange ginger sauce (the same recipe as in the original, in fact), it makes for a zesty, crunchy, one-stop, takeout-style meal that's ideal for office lunches or quick weeknight dinners. An even more convenient form of Mandarin Orange Chicken? We must be dreaming! Gladly, Trader Joe's Mandarin Style Orange Chicken Bowl is very real, and a very real value at $3.99* per 13 ounce Bowl.

Inspired by the same original soup dumplings, xiao long bao, that originated in the Jiangsu province of China, this type of dumpling is traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, the small bamboo steaming basket from which it gets its name. In English-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup (and therefore must be eaten carefully!) While the original at Trader Joe's is chicken-based, xiao long bao are traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers actually adheres closer to culinary tradition. Where we've veered most from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor player. Our recipe includes just a bit more than five percent ginger, giving these dim sum darlings a sizeable kick of pungent, spicy heat. If you have a xiaolong lying around, feel free to use it to prepare these bites. Otherwise, you can prep them the easy way, using the microwavable tray in which they're packaged. Two minutes or less in your microwave oven yields soft, hot, incredibly flavorful results. We're selling Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings in a six ounce package of six dumplings.

In fact, we were so enthusiastic about its introduction that we printed it in a Fearless Flyer before it was technically ready for prime time. Yeah. We did that. And on the front page. But the bags weren't printed, you see, so there was no way to get it into the store in time to meet expectations. But then, where there is a will, there is a way. It wasn't pretty (literally or figuratively), but we got it done-clear plastic bags with labels until the real packaging was printed. Even in an ugly package, this product hit the big time the minute it arrived, and hasn't slowed a bit since. The secret to Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken's success is in its simplicity, really. Tender chunks of juicy chicken in a crispy breading with a sweet and spicy orange sauce¿ what's not to love? And here's our favorite way to prepare it: bake the chicken in a 400º oven; when the chicken is cooked through, add the sauce to a skillet or wok; once the sauce is hot, add the chicken and toss together until the sauce adheres to the chicken and caramelizes a bit. You can also microwave the sauce and toss it with the chicken, but we think the little bit of extra effort pays off handsomely. Serve with rice and veggies for a complete meal that doesn't take much time to prepare, and delivers big flavors at a small price. We're selling each 22-ounce package of Mandarin Orange Chicken for $4.99, every day. You'll find it in our freezers.",

Perhaps it's their convenient finger food-iness, and the way they so perfectly dip into guacamole, crema sauce, or queso. To be honest, it's almost certainly all those reasons, rolled into one - pun entirely intended. That's why we're so excited to offer Trader Joe's Chicken Taquitos in our stores: they're made for us by a supplier in Mexico, who rolls a mix of expertly-seasoned white and dark chicken meat into corn tortillas, then fries them 'til they're nice and crispy.

It begins with bite-sized pieces of boneless, skinless, leg meat that have been tenderized and flavor-infused after marinating in rice wine (mirin), soy sauce, and white wine vinegar-along with garlic & ginger powders. Karaage is typically served with lemon wedges, so we intentionally added vinegar to this recipe to mimic that lovely, lemon-like tang you experience when you order the dish in a Japanese restaurant. The chicken is then dredged in a mixture of wheat flour, cornmeal, and starches, and cooked in soybean oil until crisp. The finished Karaage is frozen and packaged, ready to be reheated and eaten by you! (Use an air fryer if you have one, otherwise a conventional oven will do just fine.)

   "description": "Italian cuisine is often described as simple-a straightforward preparation of humble ingredients. And while there are many exceptions to disprove this statement, Italian dishes that exemplify the sentiment often include the term contadina in their title. In Italian, \"contadino\" means farmer, and meals that are alla contadina typically feature the bounty of a home garden, cooked in an uncomplicated way. The latest addition to our frozen case is an encapsulation of simple, unfussy, and delicious. Made for us in Italy, Trader Joe's Rigatoni alla Contadina starts with tubular Rigatoni pasta and a mix of asparagus, broccoli, and peas. They're then sautéed and tossed in a creamy sauce seasoned with garlic, herbs, nutmeg, and black pepper. Luckily, the Rigatoni have a textured exterior that helps the sauce cling to each and every noodle. Keeping in line with the simple theme here, our Rigatoni alla Contadina is super easy to prepare. Heat it up in the microwave or on the stovetop and it's ready in less than five minutes! Serve it with a side salad-our Lemony Arugula Basil Salad Kit [sku 66293] makes a fantastic pairing, and dinner is ready! Rigatoni alla Contadina",

   "description": "Shrimp, garlic, butter, lemon, and white wine. The ingredients to a classic shrimp scampi feel so made for one another, so iconic in their expression of flavor when combined, that it's somewhat shocking to realize that the dish is only about a century old. In fact, when it was invented in Italy during the 1920s, it was simply known as \"scampi,\" and featured langoustine lobster, rather than shrimp. As delicious as that certainly was, we're glad to be living in the era of the modern shrimp scampi we all know and love-an era which now includes the consummately convenient and phenomenally flavorful Trader Joe's Shrimp Scampi, available in our freezers. Made with a recipe inspired by this staple of Italian-American cuisine, each package is made with shelled, deveined, tail-off shrimp in a rich, flavorful, and enchantingly aromatic sauce made with garlic, butter, white wine, lemon juice, and a bit of grated Romano cheese for an extra touch of umami oomph. It cooks quickly and easily on the stovetop or in the oven, after which it can be served with pasta, rice, crusty bread, or entirely on its own. We like our Shrimp Scampi as a simple, satisfying, no-fuss entrée for a busy weeknight dinner, especially when paired with a side of roasted broccoli, a baked potato, and a crisp and fruity white wine-something like our subtly sparkly Espiral Vinho Verde [sku 97395], for example.

   "description": "We mentioned Trader Joe's BBQ Chicken Teriyaki includes a \"shiny\", savory sauce, so we're sure you're wondering why someone would describe this tender chicken entrée and umami BBQ glaze as \"shiny\". Well, the word \"teriyaki\" is actually a derivative of the Japanese words teri, meaning the shine or luster given by the sauce, and yaki, which refers to the process of grilling or broiling of the chicken (or whatever you're \"shining\" up with the glaze). Like teri and yaki, we believe this succulent chicken and sweet sauce should stop at nothing short of being joined together to form teriyaki. Much like the classic Japanese preparations of this dish, we like to keep the whole thing simple. Establishing the foundation for this classic dish is our dark skinless chicken leg meat - think juicy, rich, almost gamey in texture. And topping it off is our traditional sugar, soy, and sake-based sauce that would be used just fine to drench only the included chicken, but consider allowing it to soak through a carefully made bed of rice dressed with those same tender chicken strips. We're selling each 21-ounce package of Trader Joe's BBQ Chicken Teriyaki every day for $4.99* so you, too, can have this illustrious meal from freezer to fork in under ten minutes! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Each box contains three scrumptious, slider-sized Cheeseburgers, each made with a juicy, savory-seasoned, fully- cooked beef patty that's topped with a slice of Cheddar and a dollop of tangy burger sauce, all sandwiched between two halves of a sweet, tender, Hawaiian-style Aloha Roll.

Easily prepped in an oven or microwave (where they'll take less than a minute per burger to heat), these Mini Cheeseburgers can be enjoyed one by one, as an individual, anytime snack, split amongst friends as an appetizer or hors d'oeuvre, or eaten all together with a side salad as a fun, flavorful entrée. Each Mini Cheeseburger can also be customized with your favorite accoutrements, too: try topping one with caramelized onions and Aioli Garlic Mustard [sku 27677], another with a bit of Organic Coleslaw [sku 63491] and your favorite TJ's BBQ sauce, and the last with a spoonful of Crunchy Chili Onion [sku 62480] and a slice of jalapeño.

Of course, a dish with such a delightfully complex eating experience usually results from an equally complex cooking experience, and one doesn't always have the time to fire-roast, stuff, batter, and fry a whole pepper. That's what makes Trader Joe's Chiles Rellenos Con Queso so convenient-now, having a hearty chile relleno at home is simply a matter of letting it cook in the microwave, air fryer, or conventional oven, heating the included zesty tomato sauce on the stove or microwave, combining, and enjoying. An always-excellent entrée or appetizer, our frozen Chiles Rellenos make an especially great vegetarian option for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. For a quick and easy meal, try pairing them with a side of rice and beans, which will also help soak up the rich and flavorful sauce. Of course, if you're feeling extra hungry, you can always use one as the filling for a super satisfying burrito, along with some diced tomatoes, onions, and our Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole [sku 71498].

Whether it's because you are watching your calories, or simply prefer the bowl eating experience, Trader Joe's Green Chile Chicken Bowl should definitely be in your near-future meal plans. The main attraction here is antibiotic free Chicken thighs that have been simmered in Green Chile sauce, then shredded.

We like the story that it comes from a combination of the Mayan words pop (\"sphere\"), and utz (\"good\"). Aside from a visit to your local pupuseria, Trader Joe's Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas are a convenient and delicious way to satisfy all your \"good-sphere\" cravings! Pupusas begin as a ball of corn-flour dough that is flattened and stuffed with meat and cheese, then rolled back up into a sphere before being gently flattened once again to form a sort of savory, stuffed pancake. Our Pupusas are filled with chicken breast & thigh meat, shredded mozzarella cheese, and roasted Hatch chiles. These simple flavors-tender savory chicken, smooth melty cheese, and mildly smoky chili-peppers-combine to create a delicious and comforting handheld snack. We recommend you heat Trader Joe's Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas from frozen in a skillet with a bit of oil, cooking for 5 or so minutes per side until golden brown and heated through.

Typically made from a mix of eggs, potatoes, and, often, thinly sliced onions, the tortilla is a cornerstone of the Spanish culinary tradition of tapas, where it's served alongside other appetizers and finger foods. Surprisingly complex in both flavor and texture for its seemingly simple ingredient list, a Spanish tortilla can also be surprisingly difficult to make at home, which makes the ease of preparing Trader Joe's Tortilla Española all the more impressive. Made for us by a supplier in Spain who specializes in this iconic dish, our Tortilla Española only needs a few minutes on the stovetop (or a little longer in the microwave) to go from frozen to ready to serve. Rich, yet texturally light, with a well-balanced blend of savory flavors, Trader Joe's Tortilla Española is particularly suited for pairing with drinks when friends are over, or as an appetizer for an elegant dinner party. It's equally delicious when served warm, at room temperature, or even cold (as a leftover, straight out of the fridge, perhaps), and we find it makes an excellent quick breakfast option, too-especially if you top it with a bit of your favorite hot sauce.

Made for us in Italy using only the finest ingredients, our Penne Arrabbiata is a traditional Italian feast of durum semolina pasta and a tomato-based sauce that's a little tangy and, thanks to a generous amount of hot chili pepper, just enough to satisfy those dinnertime desires. You can even add some grated Parmesan if you want to stay traditional or add an alternative cheese over this tasty dish with a side of garlic bread. Mangia! You'll find each 16-ounce bag of dreamy, Trader Joe's Penne Arrabbiata imported from Italy for just $2.99, how's that for making dreams come true? *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Good news-Trader Joe's Family Style Meat Lasagna is here to answer the call for hearty, rib-sticking fare. Tender sheets of egg pasta are layered with creamy ricotta, tangy tomato sauce, and plenty of ground beef and pork seasoned with onion and garlic. Topped with an additional trifecta of cheeses-mozzarella, Romano, and Parmesan-the Lasagna is made fresh, then frozen and shipped to our stores, ready to report for \"What's for dinner?\" duty.

What makes this Kung Pao so distinctive, though, is the sauce. Traditionally, sauces for this dish are rich and savory and can range from mildly spicy to sound-the-alarm-and- grab-a-hose hot. Ours falls in the medium-spicy range-the dish will taste substantially hotter if you actually eat the chili pieces, and a little less hot if you push the chilies to the side of the plate and treat them as a garnish. We think the heat level in our sauce makes it easy to share among friends who fall on opposite sides of the spicy foods debate. If really spicy is your thing, though, you can always add your favorite spicy condiment and even more chili peppers to the finished dish. We recommend preparing our Kung Pao Chicken on the stovetop, in a really hot wok or skillet, but it can also be prepared in the microwave. Serve it with one of our frozen, ready-in-three-minutes rice options, and you'll have a complete meal that evokes the best traditions of Chinese cuisine, in your kitchen, in ten minutes or less.

Chef Kundan Lal Gujral was basically playing with a tandoor, a clay oven that conducts super high heat. Primarily used for baking bread, he was testing out how it might treat chicken. So, he would coat chicken pieces with yogurt, skewer them and place them in the tandoor...Tandoori Chicken came to be. Butter, here is where it gets better. To avoid letting leftover tandoori chicken get dry, he crafted a rich, silky (thank you, butter) tomato- and onion-based sauce with which he could enliven the meat, and thus was born the beloved Butter Chicken. Trader Joe's Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice is the ultimate #Cookinghacks for this dish. Our Butter Chicken showcases chunks of chicken enrobed in a mild, mouth-watering curry crafted of crushed tomatoes, cream, onions, garlic, ginger, butter...Spiced just so, and partnered with delicate, fragrant grains of Basmati rice, it's ready to heat and enjoy.

Oh, boy. It's time. This classic, Indian(ish) dish features chunks of chicken that have been roasted in an oven, or tandoor, and served in a creamy, mildly spicy, tomato-based, curry flavored sauce. A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain. We don't have proof, but the sources seem pretty reliable. (This explains our \"ish\" after \"Indian.\") Regardless of its origins, we can tell you that Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala with cumin-flavored basmati Rice is made just for us by a small, U.S.-based company that specializes in Indian-inspired foods. Rich and creamy sauce, tender chunks of white meat chicken, and nicely-flavored, cumin-infused basmati rice on the side, this frozen entrée makes a terrific lunch or dinner for one in less than five minutes in the microwave.

In fact, they're so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken- based counterparts. And while we've enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they've always felt different than a traditional Buffalo wing-delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category.

These Meatless Meatballs are expertly crafted from textured soy protein (TSP)-which is what remains after extracting the oil from soybeans. It's \"textured\" because it has the appearance & mouthfeel of meat. It's \"protein\" because it naturally contains a notable amount of protein-13g of protein per 4-Meatball serving. Our Meatless Meatballs are also delicious, since the TSP is seasoned like the best Italian-style meatballs, using a combination of onions, garlic powder, parsley, basil, sea salt, and black pepper-plus mushroom powder, for an umami-boost. The seasoned soy protein is then formed into couple-bite sized rounds, which are flash frozen so they're at-the-ready whenever the urge for Meatballs hits. And when it does hit, you can quickly heat these kosher, vegan, Meatless morsels using a variety of convenient methods (detailed on the package).

   "description": "They're back, they're back! Chicken-less Mandarin Orange Morsels are back! After a bit of a hiatus, you'll find this relative of our reigning Customer Choice Awards champion (commonly known as Mandarin Orange Chicken [sku 66563]) back in our freezer case where it belongs. Because our Orange Chicken is so wildly popu- lar, we're happy to say our vegan customers will once again have the chance to experience the deliciousness. This offering, of course, involved removing \"chicken\" from the equation. And that involved some tinkering- but we love tinkering. One of the best things about these Morsels is that if you didn't know they weren't chicken, you'd probably think they were chicken. But because they're not chicken, but rather a chicken-y blend of soy, this Asian inspired entrée is suitable-and quite delectable-for vegetarians and vegans alike. This Chicken-less version, of course, includes that beloved sauce that's sweet, a little spicy, and perfectly com- plements the meaty-tasting Morsels. Cook according to the directions on the package, and then serve with noodles or rice and your favorite green veggies for a complete, easy, meat-free meal. (Our favorite is over Brown Rice [sku 93756] and sautéed Bok Choy [sku 98253], garnished with sliced Green Onions [sku 44168].) The best part? You can have these Morsels, once again, without spending every morsel you have. Each 9.25-ounce package of Trader Joe's Chicken-less Mandarin Orange Morsels is $3.29, every day. 02.19. 18",

However, it's not always the most convenient to keep on hand, unless you know exactly what you're going to make with it and when. For folks who like to keep their options open (we're definitely one of those folks), we recommend the convenience of Trader Joe's Individually Frozen Boneless Skinless Chicken Thigh Meat, an uncommonly convenient, two-and-a-half pound bag of savory, succulent chicken thighs that you can keep in your freezer right until the very moment you decide how you want to enjoy them. These Chicken Thighs are all natural (meaning they were raised without hormones and contain no preservatives) and minimally processed, so they're naturally full of dark meat chicken flavor. They can be easily defrosted or thawed out, or even cooked straight from frozen, if you're in a real rush. We find their richer flavor to work particularly well when breaded and fried, but how you choose to use them is entirely up to you - that's what convenience is all about, after all. Speaking of convenience, you can find our 40-ounce bags of Individually Frozen Chicken Thigh Meat conveniently placed in our freezers, every day. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Baker, the father of what we know as the \"Chicken Nugget\". He was a food science professor at Cornell University, where he invented the \"Chicken Crispie\" in the 1950s. Baker's innovation was an effective way to form chicken in any shape and produce a batter that would stay intact both in the deep fryer and the freezer. In 1997, we brought our version of the \"Chicken Crispie\"... drum roll please... let us welcome, Trader Joe's Chicken Drummellas to our freezers and onto your dinner plates!

But, in an unexpected turnover, the chicken wing has intercepted the top spot for beloved bar nosh and ubiquitous sports-watching snacks. Now, Trader Joe's brings our own version of wings to the table (or bar top). Our new Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings have a list of stats that will make it hard-if not impossible-to catch a game without wanting them close-at-hand. Here's what makes our Wings soar above local pub grub: First, they come from vegetarian chickens. That means our California-grown birds are raised on a balanced diet of corn and soybean meal. They are never fed animal fat or animal by-products. Second, our Wings are 100% antibiotic-free (ABF). This is especially notable, since Trader Joe's is currently the only retailer selling completely ABF, hot and spicy wings. Third, our Wings are super easy to prepare. They've been fully cooked and promptly frozen. This means they're ready to heat at a moment's notice, in the microwave or conventional oven. Like the original Buffalo wings, ours are \"sectioned\" (cut in half), and covered in a spicy sauce made from vinegar, cayenne peppers, and chile pepper extract. These bite- (or three) sized snacks are the perfect finger- food. Spray canola oil on your baking tray for extra-crispy wings. And, be sure to have some cool dip at the ready. Try our Low-Fat Parmesan Ranch [sku 17784], or our Greek Style Feta Dressing [sku 93244] as the perfect foil for the spicy, vinegary sauce-with a handful of Cut & Peeled Baby Carrots [sku 70588] on the side. Each 16-ounce (1-pound) bag of our Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings is $5.99. Move some down the field-from our freezer to yours-and you'll be primed for the next big game! 11.10. 14",

It does of course, and Trader Joe's Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets are the latest tasty development in chicken chunk flavor and technology. We start with chickens that are hatched in the United States and raised on an all-vegetarian diet, without the use of antibiotics. We use only whole muscle, breast-meat chunks that we've enhanced with seasonings (in- stead of a mish-mash of pieces and parts). For the batter and breading, wheat flour is replaced with corn flour, rice flour, and a combination of potato starch and cornstarch. This makes our nuggets completely gluten free. They're also certified to be clear of 7 major allergens, including: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. And the flavor? As they cook for 12 to 15 minutes in a 425ºF oven, you'll begin to experience the savory garlic aroma. After a minute or two of cooling at room temperature, you'll be surprised at the incredible crunch fac- tor. Bite into the crispy exterior and you'll taste moist, tender breast-meat inside. These golden-brown nuggets may not actually be \"gold,\" but when you serve them to your friends and family, they'll disappear like they are! One final nugget of wisdom: Go get your one-pound bag (about 16 pieces) of our Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets for $4.99 and save yourself the belly-ache (if your belly's intolerant to gluten), and the extra dollars you would've spent elsewhere on similar (but not as good!) nuggets. 8.15.1 4",

When it comes to meat, however, \"enhancements\" are not preferred. What you want is meat that is free from extras and as close as possible to what you'd get if you harvested it yourself. Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Wings come to you and to your freezer without enhancements. Our chickens are from the Mid-Atlantic region; hatched, raised, harvested, and packaged in the U.S.A. They grow up eating organic feed their entire lives, and their corn and soy-based diet is without added antibiotics. They are free to roam in spacious, naturally lit houses, with additional access to large outdoor pens. Once harvested, no broth or \"solution\" is added to enhance the Chicken flavor. Our Wing Sections, comprised only of first and mid-joints (no wing tips!), are individually flash-frozen. This quick freeze at very low temperature forms a thin glaze of ice, keeping each piece of chicken as fresh as frozenly possible. When you're ready to cook it, there's no need for thawing. Just take what you want from the re-sealable package and pop it directly in the oven, frying pan, or on the grill. The rest remains frozen for next time! Ironically, Trader Joe's enhancement-free Organic Wings are destined to enhance your next party, snack, or meal with their convenient, pure-chicken goodness. Each 32 ounce (2 pound) bag is $6.99.

We introduced the famed, pizza-esque tartes flambées to Trader Joe's many years ago, starting with our Tarte d'Alsace [sku 81279]. Our customers instantly fell in love with the thin, crispy, hand-formed crust topped with crème fraîche, ham and Gruyère. Building on its success, we introduced another traditional iteration that focused on mushrooms-Tarte aux Champignons [sku 93281]. Also a triumph, we felt the collection could- should-be continued. Because our customers are as crazy for Brie as they are for tarte flambée, we thought the soft-ripened, French cheese would be natural to showcase atop the compellingly crispy crust. Cut into little pieces, the buttery Brie is liberally sprinkled over the crust along with ripe, sweetly-acidic cherry tomato halves. Complemented by crème fraîche and a hint of whole grain mustard, our Tarte au Brie et aux Tomates is a savory decadence. Crisp it on the rack of a 450ºF oven for 10 minutes, and serve it with fresh, green salad for a delightful meal. Or, cut it into small bites for a sophisticated hors d'oeuvre.

These colorful, plen- tiful vegetables sit atop a crisp and chewy sourdough crust (made from a long-rise dough) that is spread with a well-seasoned tomato sauce and sprinkled with a blend of mozzarella and hard aged cheese. The taste-experience alone is enough to make you forget about pepperoni-at least for a few minutes. In addition to the great flavor-combination, this pizza really stands out for its Organic attribute. There are many frozen pizzas on the market that claim to be \"made with some organic ingredients,\" but very few that are like ours. From dough to sauce to cheese to veggies, Trader Giotto's Roasted Vegetable Pizza is wholly Or- ganic-100%. This frozen pie bakes up in your 425ºF oven in just 12-15 minutes at a cost that, like our ingredients, includes no unnecessary additives. $4.49 puts this 16.08-ounce Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza in your hands-and shortly thereafter, in your mouth. So go ahead... Eat your vegetables! 10.05. 15",

   "description": "Nope. Nothing ordinary here. This pizza is so extra-ordinary, really, that we don't even call it a pizza. Nah-ah. It's a flatbread. And not any ordinary flatbread. This one hails from the small Italian town of Visso, deep in the mountains of the extraordinary Monte Sibillini National Park. Do you see the pattern of extraordinary-ness? And we haven't even gotten to what's on the flatbread! Let's do that, post-haste. Trader Joe's Burrata, Prosciutto, & Arugula Flatbread begins with a hand-stretched flatbread crust that's fired in brick ovens. It's topped with an indulgent mascarpone garlic cream sauce, wild baby arugula, mozzarella, fon- tal, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. Oh, and burrata-we mustn't forget the burrata, the extraordinary Italian formaggio crafted of fresh mozzarella and cream. But that's not all-after all, this is an extraordinary pizza we're describing. This one finishes with thinly sliced prosciutto that you add to the top to finish the masterpiece. You can add it prior to or after baking-we prefer to add it just after baking, so that it warms just a bit but doesn't cook. You might think this extraordinary Flatbread would come with an extravagant price. Nope. Even our price is extraordinary. We're selling each twelve-ounce Burrata, Prosciutto, & Arugula Flatbread for $4.99, every day. You'll find it in our freezers. 8.10.1 5",

   "description": "There's Italian food, and there's American food. And then, there's Italian-American food. Our Wood Fired Naples Style Uncured Pepperoni Pizza best fits that last category. It's a hybrid pie from two countries; a simple pizza combining the best ingredients we could find. The authentically Italian pizza crust is made for us near Bologna, Italy. Wheat-flour dough is allowed to rise naturally for 24 hours. Then, it's hand-formed, Naples Style-thin in the middle, with big edges. Next, the elev- en-inch crust is baked in a wood-burning stone oven. With the \"Italian\" part finished, our crust is then delivered to an American city renowned for its pizza-Chicago. There, our Wood Fired Naples Style crust is topped with tomato sauce, and a blend of four cheeses: Provolone, Fontina, Monterey Jack, and Parmesan. Finally, it's crowned with a distinctly American touch: eighteen slices of Uncured Pepperoni. Pepperoni is an American innovation-a variety of salami developed in the early 1900s by Italian immigrants to emulate the spicy, dry salami varieties found in southern Italy. In this case, the pepperoni is \"uncured,\" meaning it has no added nitrites or nitrates, except what naturally occurs in celery powder. With its Italian crust, American pepperoni, and a Trader Joe's price ($4.99 for the 15.2 ounce frozen pie), we think our Wood Fired Naples Style Uncured Pepperoni Pizza is absolutely the best value frozen pizza these three cultures have to offer. 03.14. 16",

However, there are several ways this new Pizza is different¿ First, it's rectangular (instead of round). Practically, this means more variety when you slice it. Using a few vertical cuts and a couple horizontal cuts, you'll end up with some regular pieces (with some crust), corner pieces (with extra crust), and even some no-crust pieces. Speaking of crust, this one is slightly thicker and chewier. In fact, it's our supplier's best selling pizza crust! This Pizza is also bigger. We call it Family Size because it serves four people (instead of three, as in our round version). Lastly, this pizza piles on the cheese, including four different kinds: mozzarella, provolone, Emmentaler, and an aged cheese similar to Parmesan. Whether you simply bake it as-is, or use it as a base for personalizing with your favorite toppings, Trader Joe's Organic Cheese & Tomato Pizza is definitely a people pleaser! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Fried food = delicious. Fried pizza? Doubly delicious! It comes in many forms in the streets of Naples, and, now, in the frozen aisles of your local Trader Joe's, it comes in the form of Trader Joe's Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried Crust. Our Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza is made for us authentically in Naples, where our supplier takes great care in replicating the lengthy, artisanal process of this particular pizza-making method. The dough is matured for 90 hours, then fermented for 6 additional hours, and while its fermenting, they manually fold the dough three times a day. Once the dough reaches peak readiness, our supplier shapes it by hand and deep fries it in sunflower seed oil for a quick three minutes. The result is a crust that is at once perfectly crunchy and dreamily airy, chewy, and pillowy. The toppings are just as key as the crust, and we didn't skimp there, either-our Product Developer based the recipe on one of the best pizzas she's ever had, which came from a teeny-tiny little pizzeria in Bari, Italy. Accordingly, we top each Deep Fried Crust with mozzarella, provolone, Parmigiano Reggiano, and-most importantly-dollops of burrata and fresh pesto with roasted garlic. It sounds fancy, but fortunately, this little slice of Italy won't cost you an expensive plane ticket; thanks to each 14.1 oz. TJ's Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza, you can experience Naples for just $5.99*.

There's a good reason for that: the relative simplicity and mild nuttiness of lightly cooked soy beans make them an ideal amuse bouche to the vivid flavors of sushi and sashimi. Of course, those very same qualities also make them an ideal addition to salads, soups, and stir-fries, and a superb standalone snack, too. That's why we offer Trader Joe's Lightly Salted Edamame, so you can enjoy edamame in any situation you want - not just when you're able to make the trek to the sushi bar. Hand-picked in Southeast Asia, our supplier prepares each pod by giving them a light sprinkling of salt, then blanching until it's just done, and finally flash freezing them to retain their snappy, semi-firm texture. Once thawed, our Edamame is totally ready to serve on its own, but there's plenty you can do to enhance it, if you're so inclined: try heating things up with a dash of chili powder, poured directly over the pods: you'll get a nice, but not overwhelming, bit of spice as you squeeze the beans directly into your mouth. Or, you can shell the beans and add them to fried rice, succotash, or pasta. No matter how you enjoy them, you're in for a treat - and an impressive nine grams of protein per serving, to boot.

These days our lives may not be at stake, but we are just as pas- sionate about yummy fungi as our imaginary prehistoric counterparts would have been. If there's any ques- tion, Trader Joe's Mushroom Medley should settle the debate!

Three to five minutes on the stovetop or in the microwave is all it takes to deliver a hot and flavorful portion. Try it atop your favorite pizza or burger.

Back when most people tended to prepare them by boiling them, Brussels sprouts had a general reputation for being mushy and unpleasant - and frozen Brussels sprouts fared even worse. It was only after crispy, roasted and skillet-fried Brussels sprouts proliferated in restaurants nationwide that this brassica's star began to rise again. Working hand in hand with a trusted supplier in France, we set out to capture that same satisfyingly crisp texture in a frozen format, and we're proud to say that Trader Joe's Roasted Seasoned Brussels Sprouts passes the textural test with flying colors. It turns out the secret is deceptively simple: our supplier slices the Sprouts in half, roasts them to a fine, toothsome texture, then individually flash freezes them at the height of crispness before adding a suite of savory seasonings including garlic, parmesan, olive oil, salt, and pepper. With all that prep out of the way, effectively all that's separating you and this hearty side is heating it back up, either in the skillet or in the oven. After that, they make a prime, steakhouse-style side for practically any protein. We find that they make a compellingly convenient component for weekly meal prepping, too. Boy, what a difference a bit of texture makes! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Roasted Seasoned Brussels Sprouts",

   "description": "Call us corny if you must, but we've always been big fans of corn on the cob. Not just on a culinary level either- we've always found the act of eating corn on the cob to be a lot of fun, in and of itself. So when we found out there was a way to make that treasured activity even more fun (and even more delicious, to boot!), we jumped at the opportunity (and for joy) to bring in Trader Joe's Seasoned Corn Ribs to our freezers. Made with plant- based butter and just the right amount of salt, these deliciously buttery, and decidedly vegan \"Ribs\" are as corny as you can get, in all the best ways. They're made for us by a supplier in Italy, who slices cobs of corn into quarters and then lightly cooks them until they naturally take on a slightly curved, barbecued rib-like shape. After that, they season them with salt and an olive oil and cocoa butter-based vegan butter, before flash freezing them and sending them our way. They can be prepared in a manner of minutes in your microwave, or a little longer in the oven or air fryer, and make a fantastic plant-based side for all kinds of fare, barbecue or otherwise. For some extra flavor and elotes- inspired fun, try customizing them with lime juice, chili powder, and Cotija [sku 65005] just prior to serving. Seasoned Corn Ribs",

Recently, after a trip to a favorite fast-food joint, our Buyer was struck by a spud-tacular realization: we. need. Waffle. Cut. Fries. So, she reached out to the Italian supplier of our revered Roasted Potatoes, Peppers & Onions [sku 55969], and the rest is French-fried history. Allow us to introduce the latest tater on the block: Trader Joe's Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries. Our supplier starts with sliced potatoes, then gives said slices that wonderful Waffle Cut. We can't share the top-secret technology behind this marvel of geometry (a spud never reveals its secrets), but we can say that the cut itself adds a certain je ne sais quoi to the overall fry-eating experience. Next, these waffle-like potatoes are coated in a flour-based batter, fried in vegetable oil, and, finally, seasoned with a blend of salt, paprika, black pepper, yeast extract, and garlic, onion & chili powders. (Bonus: there's seasoning in the batter, too!) Whether you bake them in the oven or crisp them in the air-fryer, enjoy them solo or dip 'em in your favorite sauce¿ Trader Joe's Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries are where it's at. So don't wait, don't waiver, and don't waffle- grab a bag at your neighborhood TJ's today! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries",

Trader Joe's Mashed Potatoes are prepped for your time-saving convenience and the entire bag can be heated in the microwave or stovetop in under 10 minutes. But what if you don't want to heat the whole bag at once? No problem! These Mashed Potatoes have been frozen and portioned into little cylinders, making it easy to prepare as much or as little as you'd like. And when it comes to the ingredients-potatoes, milk, butter, and salt-that's it. Our Mashed Potatoes are made with the same, simple ingredients you'd use if you made them from scratch. While our Mashed Potatoes make an ultra-comforting side dish on their own, if you want to add some oomph, they present an exemplary canvas for a variety of toppings. Turkey Flavored Gravy [sku 93173] is a classic, and a pat of Salted Butter [sku 6252] can never be beat. Gourmet Fried Onion Pieces [sku 28909] add a pleasant crunch and pop of umami to every bite.

Our latest frozen fare is a simple, ultra-versatile, heat-and-eat side that packs a big punch of flavor, making it our new go-to building block for weekday meals. Introducing, Trader Joe's Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage. Inspired by the Thai dish, Galam Plee Pad Nam Pla-a simple stir-fry of cabbage, a whole lot of garlic, and fish sauce-our version is deliciously similar, but instead of fish sauce, we season the cabbage with a vegan stir-fry sauce made with yeast extract and kombu. It imparts a similar umami boost that fish sauce usually brings to dishes, without the fish! Ready in under 10 minutes, you can heat it up in the microwave or on the stovetop. And because it's easy to prepare, we think it will solve your \"what's for breakfast and lunch?\" quandary, too. Try topping the Cabbage with a fried egg for breakfast or toss it with rice for a quick lunch. It goes splendidly with a variety of proteins and makes a grand addition to soups. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, try our Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage as an easy filling for homemade dumplings. Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage",

Thankfully, your neighborhood Trader Joe's offers scores of sides that are both delicious and ready to enjoy in just minutes-no planning required. Trader Joe's Garlic Shiitake Green Beans is an excellent example. Our supplier in Thailand, who also makes our Lightly Salted Edamame [sku 51063], knows a thing or two about preparing high-quality, frozen legumes. In this case, they start with Thai-grown green beans, par-cook them, and season them with a seriously umami-licious, soy-based sauce that's amped up with garlic & shiitake mushrooms. The dish is flash-frozen, packaged, and delivered to our stores, where you can pick it up any day of the week. Getting these Garlic Shiitake Green Beans ready for their supporting supper role is a swift, five-minute affair. It requires just a quick sauté & steam on the stovetop-or a handful of microwave minutes. The still-firm beans, with their garlic-forward flavor and delicious mushroom undertones, pair well with Trader Joe's Beef Bulgogi [sku 75283] and your favorite TJ's rice... but there are many more mains that would be happy to call this savory bean dish their sidekick!

Now here is a vegetable medley that transcends the ordinary in every way. Not content to offer the usual veggie blends you can find just about anywhere, we set out to put together extraordinary vegetables that you and your family can enjoy every day. Our Organic Foursome is a blend of super sweet corn, green peas, julienne-sliced carrots and green beans- all organic, all wonderfully fresh-tasting. Trader Joe's Organic Foursome is the kind of vegetable blend you can serve to even the pickiest kids without fear that they'll turn away in defiance-there's something there for everyone, right? It's also flavorful enough that you'll want to enjoy it with them. Of course, you can serve these veggies just as they are and be quite pleased with the results. You could also mix things up a bit. Add them to a pasta salad, toss them into fried rice in a wok or skillet, or build a vegetarian village-we're picturing buildings made of corn and colorful little people made of green beans (body), peas (head) and carrots (arms & legs).

When we first introduced them, however, they were much less common - so uncommon in fact, that there were some that called us foolhardy (that can happen). We do like a good risk, yet questions remained: Would the traditionalists bite? Would the non-fry folks even consider entering the fry fray? Years on, we have our unequivocal answers: yes and yes! We won't attempt to take credit for any kind of trend-setting here, but we will boast of having the best sweet potato fries you can get out of a freezer (and it's worth noting, most of the sweet potato fries you've had in restaurants have come from the freezer, too). Trader Joe's Sweet Potato Frites are bright, golden-orange spears of sweet potato with the skins removed. They're steam blanched and par-fried before being frozen, so they retain their fresh flavor and vibrant color. They bake to a crisp exterior that yields to a creamy-yet-still-slightly-firm interior. They're mildly sweet (naturally), excellent with all kinds of dips - ketchup, mustard, ranch, sriracha, barbecue sauce, mayo, chili sauce¿ We're selling each 15 ounce bag of Sweet Potato Frites for $1.99, every day, a terrific value you'll find only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

Edamame has been gaining popularity ever since. If Trader Joe's had been around in 13th century Japan, we're pretty sure our fully-cooked Shelled Edamame would have been a hit. Edamame, which means \"stem bean\" in Japanese, is loved for its mild, slightly nutty taste and good source of protein. Our Shelled Edamame comes to us from Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, where the pods are hand picked and removed from their pods, then lightly blanched and quick frozen, ensuring fresh and perfectly crunchy beans in every bag. Edamame makes a great anywhere-or-anytime snack, served hot or cold. To serve cold, defrost overnight under refrigeration and it's ready to go. To serve hot, pour pods into microwave-safe dish and heat for 3-4 minutes at 50% power (depending on microwave). Season to taste and enjoy!

   "description": "Fruit leathers have historically taken up a variety of physical shapes: strips, shreds, wraps¿ Now, Trader Joe's is bringing Buttons to the dried-fruit party! Each individual package contains eight, small circles of flattened, dried Fruit Leather. The Buttons are laid out in a row between two, long strips of paper that have been folded in fourths to fit the cute-as-a-button package. But there are a few additional ways our Buttons are not like other dried-fruit snacks you've seen. First, they include fruit-puree concentrate, instead of simply the juice concentrates that form the base of other products. Second, our supplier dries the Buttons for eight hours using a special warm-air drying process to create their smooth, soft, slightly sticky texture. There is no comparison to those waxy, tough-textured fruit leathers that are formed with a high-heat process. And third, when it comes to taste, our Grape-Mango Fruit Leather Buttons are also a cut above. Instead of being apple-based (like most other leathers), our Buttons have organic mango purée as their base (with organic grape juice concentrate), which is why they're bursting with sweet, subtly tart, flavor that beats any non-Button varieties we've tested.

If we were songwriters, and not Flyer writers, we'd probably write a song about it. So we'll stick to what we do best; tell you all about this tartastic juice, Flyer-style.

Trader Joe's Organic Apple Juice is a fruitfully flavorful, while not cloyingly sweet, refreshing beverage to enjoy on a toasty, early autumn day or a crisp, chilly late fall night. It all begins with A+ quality apples - after being carefully picked, the apples are washed, macerated, and pressed to expel all that juicy-fruit goodness! Then, most of the water is evaporated, creating a concentrate. When the Organic Apple Juice's concentrate is ready to be turned into the product you know and love, it's beefed back up with filtered water and ascorbic acid. We then filter and pasteurize the Organic Apple Juice to bring on its final form: the sippingly smooth sweet fruit juice prepared to be bottled and sold.

Spanish explorers are said to have ¿ rst brought the fruit to the Philippines, and today, that country is the world's largest pineapple-growing region. ¿ e tropical climate is ideal for cultivating this sweet-tart fruit, and this fruit produces particularly delicious juice. Trader Joe's 100% Pineapple Juice really is 100% of the pineapple (with foliage removed). Yes, the whole fruit. Our supplier takes whole fruits and puts them through a juicer, so not a single bit of these great-tasting fruits is lost. Most pineapple juice in cans is from concentrate, but ours is 100% juice, not from concentrate. Fruit to juicer to can to Trader Joe's-that's a pretty succinct summation of how this juice gets to you. For a beverage with only one ingredient, our 100% Pineapple Juice is quite versatile. Chill it down, drink it straight, or add it to your favorite cocktails. Mai tais, anyone? We're selling Trader Joe's 100% Pineapple Juice in 4-packs of 8.45 ounce cans for $2.99, a big value for 100% juice that tastes this good.",

What better morsel to meet you in such a heavenly status, than that divinely classic cloud-like delicacy known as Trader Joe's Vanilla Meringues? Although it's hard to believe, these fluffy fantasies aren't exactly from heaven. They actually come to us from a bakery in San Marcos, California. They are carefully crafted by beating together egg whites, causing the proteins to unfold and recombine into a new structure around air bubbles and sugar. The result is a light, fluffy indulgence with a simple sweetness, and an alluring vanilla aroma. Now, here's how the cookie crumbles: Take a bite and crunch, crunch, crunch... then comes the melt in your mouth miracle. Clearly, their cloud-like wonderment extends to the nutrition facts, as our Meringues are gluten free, kosher (dairy), and fat free. Enjoy these, delicately, with a warm cup of Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange Tea [sku 56325] or dipped in melted-down Trader Joe's Chocolate Chips [sku 04529].

Never ones to settle for second-rate sweets, our buyers seized the opportunity to improve upon the existing product, making it their mission to upgrade Trader Joe's Gluten Free Joe-Joe's with the latest in gluten free baked good technology-backed by a baking partner with more than 65 years of experience, no less-and lo and behold, here we are!

It's made from a base of earthy, nutty sunflower butter (it's the first ingredient, in fact), to which our supplier adds an assortment of gluten free flours and vegan sources of sweetness, including cane sugar, dates, and pear juice concentrate, as well as a generous amount of roasted sunflower seeds. They then bake them to a perfectly pleasing soft texture, which not only interacts wonderfully with the crunch of the seeds, but accentuates its interplay of sweet and savory flavors, too. Sized about one or two bites, these Sunflower Butter Cookies make an excellent, peanut-free dessert for school lunches, a great mid-morning pick-me-up with a cup of coffee or tea, or even just an anytime indulgence. In addition to being vegan, kosher (pareve), and gluten free, they also contain no soy, sesame, or tree nuts, making them a great option for allergen-conscious sharing.

Once prepared, it's either enjoyed for its creamy, mild-flavored, original state, or it's smoked and dried for extended periods of time, which helps preserve the cheese and transforms it into a savory, chewy, almost gum-like snack.

In that spirit, we've brought in Trader Joe's Chhurpi Dog Chews all the way from Nepal, to give our furry, four-legged friends a chance to engage in this uniquely Himalayan tradition.

   "description": "Almond butter is not just for spreading on sandwiches. You can use it as a base for sauces, blend it into smoothies and milkshakes, or slather it on celery sticks. We particularly enjoy it as the featured ingredient in Trader Joe's Almond Butter Granola. It starts with a base of rolled oats, whole California-grown almonds and smooth, nutty almond butter. The oats and almonds contribute to this granola's generous protein and fiber content, 5g and 4g, respectively, without the use of additional protein sources like soy to up the ante. Crisped brown rice is blended with a touch of honey and a smattering of coconut flakes, then thrown into the oat & almond mix for added crunch. Finally, a dash of vanilla and sea salt are added to round out the flavors of this slightly sweet, slightly salty, fully tasty granola. Trader Joe's Almond Butter Granola is baked into golden clusters that make it easy to enjoy on the go. Throw some into your bag with an apple and Organic Beef Jerky [sku 95962] to keep you going in the great outdoors (or on your not-so-great commute). If you have more time to stop and smell the granola, sprinkle a handful atop your favorite yogurt with sliced strawberries. Or simply pour it into a bowl with Unsweetened Almond Beverage [sku 53214] for a crunchy almond trifecta that will keep you satisfied until lunchtime.

   "description": "\"Gotta love crab. In the nick of time, too. I couldn't take much more of those coconuts¿\" ~ Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks in Castaway) Chuck Noland is the exception. Unless you remain stranded on a tropical island, it is probably more likely that you can't get enough coconut. (And if you're reading this, we're assuming you've been rescued.) Landlubbers, like yourself, are typically fond of Trader Joe's because of our comforting cache of coconut products that help fill your coconut fix. Our newest coconut product comes in the form of granola: Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Coconut Granola. We love this granola for a number of reasons. First, it's 100% organic and totally gluten free. Second, the total list of organic ingredients is pretty simple and relatively short: rolled oats, coconut flakes (from Sri Lanka), roasted almonds, corn flakes, maple syrup, quinoa, coconut oil, brown rice flour, cane sugar, vanilla extract, and sea salt. Which leads to the third reason we love this granola: despite the mention of both syrup and sugar, this granola contains only 6g of sugar per 1/3 cup serving. Granola-lovers know this is on the lower end of sugar content for snacks like this. Everything comes together to form a delightfully crunchy, significantly coconutty snack that's as good in a bowl with milk, as it is munched straight out of the bright-yellow, re-sealable bag. Reason number four you're going to love Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Coconut Granola? Each 12-ounce bag is just $3.99.

And since they're so delightfully draconic in shape, they're also great for adding an adventurous visual element to cupcakes or frosted sugar cookies. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Some have been flavored with sesame seeds and honey, others flavored with Thai limes and chiles, but our latest venture into the cashew milieu might be the most unique yet: cashews flavored with¿cashews! Or, to be more specific, cashew butter. Indeed, Trader Joe's Cashew Butter Cashews combine the classic crunch and savory flavor of one of our favorite nuts with the sweet and nutty splendor of silky cashew butter, resulting in a remarkably delicious (if curiously recursive) snack. Our supplier, a confectioner who specializes in candied nut treats like these, makes each batch by coating honey roasted cashews in a thick layer of creamy cashew butter, which itself is dotted by bits of crushed cashews. Each bite has a satisfying mix of soft and crunchy textures, as well as sweet and lightly salty flavors, making them an ideal treat for bringing to the movies, bringing along for car rides or commutes, or enjoying by the handful on a hike.

It wasn't until the 1950's, however, that soft and chewy licorice rose to prominence across Australasia. According to legend, one candy company accidentally created a batch far softer than they meant to, and gave it away to local children for free. It proved to be a tremendous hit, and more than 70 years later, it remains one of the most popular styles of licorice globally. Trader Joe's Trio of Soft Licorice Twists is of this superbly soft and pleasantly chewy variety, and also contain the additional twist (see what we did there?) of coming in three phenomenally fruity flavors: ripe raspberry, tropical mango, and tart green apple. Ideal for any situation that calls for sweet snacking, Trader Joe's Trio of Soft Licorice Twists can be enjoyed as a movie candy, a school lunch dessert, or, our personal favorite, as an anytime, \"just-because\" treat. We find that its complementary mix of flavors strikes a nice balance of consistency and variety: just enough of each to keep every bite interesting. And if you've got a road trip, ball game, or amusement park outing on your horizon, a Trio of Soft Licorice Twists makes a capital companion. Trio of Soft Licorice Twists",

While we may not know exactly who first had the idea to blend ice cream with crushed-up chocolate sandwich cookies, there's one thing we can safely assume-that person was a genius! And since the late 1970s, this cookies-and-cream concept has been applied to cakes, milkshakes, candy bars, and even trail mixes. Now Trader Joe's has added another shining star to the cookies-and-cream universe: Cookies & Crème Pretzel Slims. The base for these treats is Trader Joe's Pretzel Slims [sku 87777] with their thin, crisp, salty character. Each Pretzel is dunked in a creamy confectionary coating that includes notes of natural vanilla flavor, and crushed bits of Trader Joe's Chocolate Vanilla Bean Cream Joe-Joe's cookies [sku 82756]. That would be enough-but we couldn't help but add a final flourish of chocolatey drizzle. Are Trader Joe's Cookies & Crème Pretzel Slims worthy of their ingenius heritage? Perhaps you might weigh in.

Recently, we updated their packaging to keep up with the times, but Trader Joe's Yogurt Pretzels are still the same classic snack with the same salty-tangy-crunchy-creamy twist that's been throwing us for a loop since 2009.

We've heard people exclaim, upon popping a piece of the stuff into their mouths, \"Ooh, I can really taste the salt water!\" At those times, we don't have the heart to reveal the inaccuracy of the legend. That's right; salt water taffy isn't made with salt water. Back in the late 19th century, a candy shop in Atlantic City, New Jersey was flooded, and all of the shop's taffy was soaked with salty ocean water. The legend that stuck has the shop owner making the best of a bad situation by offering his customers \"salt water taffy,\" and they quite literally ate it up. So, while you'll often find this treat on boardwalks and around beaches, it isn't made with salt water. It is, however, usually made with all kinds of junk ingredients. But not at Trader Joe's. Ours is made with naturally-derived flavors and colors, and without artificial preservatives of any kind. Each 7-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Salt Water Taffy contains five flavors: cherry, strawberry banana, red licorice, sour apple, and watermelon. The flavors are bright and cheery, like a summer day at the beach. The price of $1.99 a bag is, well, legendary.

Given her own proclivity for ducking dairy products, our Product Developer sympathized with these villagers. So, when she caught sight of Sweet Rose® Coconut Whipped Topping at a national food expo, she knew what she must do: take this vegan Topping to Trader Joe's.

He's a cute, yellow teddy bear - short and stout and wears a little red t-shirt, who has an endless love for honey. Something like \"Pinnie-the-Wooh\" sound familiar? Oh, how he would adore Trader Joe's Multi-Floral and Clover Honey... so do we, and you will too! It's luscious, mildly sweet and amber-colored honey. We used to call this stuff simply \"Clover Honey,\" but the bees can pollinate & forage the nectar of whatever plants they choose. So, on account of the fact that a different species of flora could lure the bees out of their beloved clover fields from time to time, we've added \"Multi-Floral\" to its moniker. It's very similar to our 24-ounce Multi-Floral & Clover Honey [sku 47195], but this one is in a classic 12-ounce squeezable bear, so cute you just want to squeeze 'em.

   "description": "When was the last time you thought about the amazing origins of honey? This sweet treat is the product of hard-working bees that spend their lives sucking nectar from flowers; converting those complex sugars into simple sugars using enzymes from their bodies; and fanning the stored honey with their wings (after its been deposited in the honeycomb) until the water content is reduced just enough to resist fermentation and thicken into rich, flavorful food. We think something so precious should be delivered as simply and naturally as possible, and that's what we've attempted with our Organic Unfiltered Honey from Uruguay. It's carefully gathered from Uruguayan beehives, where the bees are living in proximity to eucalyptus and a variety of forest wildflower blooms. The harvested Honey is gently warmed to reverse any crystallization that has occurred, then loosely strained-just to remove foreign material, such as pieces of honeycomb. What remains is golden-hued honey that's cloudier than full- filtered honey. It's thick & sticky with mild, sweet honey flavor. It's delicious! Considering the hard work of the bees, we would be justified in charging a lot for this Organic Honey. However, considering our Customers-and their preference for value-we've decided to sell each 16-ounce squeeze bottle of Trader Joe's Organic Unfiltered Honey from Uruguay for $5.99, while our supply lasts.

   "description": "Forget the apple. A spoonful of Manuka Honey each day carries some serious, health-promoting sway. Highly- valued and widely-used for its stable and powerful non-peroxide antibacterial activity, this honey is something special. The exorbitant pricing (a small jar can run from $20 - $50 dollars and up!) on Manuka, however, has been a barrier for some folks. Until now. While traveling in New Zealand, our buyers discovered the only Manuka Honey producer who is 100% vertically integrated. From the hives to the honey jar lid, they tend to it all. This structure allows for consistent production, as well as successful cost management-which leads to our exceptional price of $10.99 for a 8.8-ounce jar. Of course, it's what's in the jar that makes the real difference, and the quality of Mother Earth® New Zealand Manuka Honey is exceptional. The hives are located in a remote valley on the North Island of New Zealand, where the bees collect nectar exclusively from the flowers of the Manuka bush (also known as the \"Tea Tree\"). This singular pollen source is responsible for the robust flavor, which is sweet, with notes of menthol and eucalyptus. The monofloral pollen source is also responsible for the sought after health-promoting potency, indicated by a Unique Manuka Factor (UMFTM) classification of: 10+. (The UMFTM is a trademark of the Active Manuka Honey Organization, which has derived an internationally recognized testing and ranking process to verify the existence and strength of the non-peroxide antibacterial activity (10+ is good!). It is a designation that cannot appear on product packaging without licensure to do so, and since we know our customers are specifically looking for this attribute, we made the decision to replace our private-label TJ's Manuka Honey [sku 50760] with our vendor's branded version: Mother Earth® New Zealand Manuka Honey. It's the exact same honey that meets the exact same standards, only these standards are now more clearly noted. Honey, it's legit! You'll find it in our grocery aisle.",

   "description": "When sweet and savory come together successfully, it's always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that's an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced Organic Spicy Honey Sauce [sku 69094]. However, it was difficult to source a steady supply; switching to a conventional honey base allows us to ensure consistent availability, and offer it in a larger format. Win-win! This new iteriation of Trader Joe's Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. It has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones. From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake [sku 31185], a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it's added to an extra element of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked Organic Biscuits [sku 73768], air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts [sku 88109], roasted veggies, or barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you're really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed. Spicy Honey Sauce",

Plus, the paper itself is milled in Canada and Wisconsin, by two Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)®-certified sustainable operations. Pretty cool, eh?

We love these fuzzy, spherical dryer-sheet alternatives, and we suspect you will, too. You know what they say-dryer sheets are temporary, but dryer balls are forever¿ Soft, off-white, and about the size of a tennis ball, each Trader Joe's Wool Dryer Ball is hand-made in Nepal, using 100% New Zealand sheep's wool. In a process known as \"felting,\" skilled workers wrap the wool into loose balls, wet them with warm water, hand-roll them while applying significant pressure, then lay them in the sun to dry. (The combination of moisture and warmth works to compact and stiffen the wool fibers-if you've ever had the misfortune of accidentally tossing your favorite wool sweater in the wash, you're familiar with this phenomenon¿) Finally, once the Wool Balls are completely dry, they're grouped into sets of four, packaged in cotton drawstring bags (no plastic packaging here, folks!), and shipped to your neighborhood TJ's. Trader Joe's Wool Dryer Balls can be reused for years on end-they really are the perfect, eco-chic replacement for those waxy, disposable dryer sheets you've been using. Simply toss all four Balls in the dryer with your laundry, and they'll reduce static, decrease dry time, make clothes fluffier, and keep fabrics softer. Unlike others on the market, our Wool Dryer Balls are free from dyes and fragrances. But that said, if you would like to scent your laundry, just add a few drops of your favorite essential oil (time to break out the TJ's Essential Oils Collection!) to one of the Dryer Balls, and you'll have laundry that's lightly scented but still free from chemical fragrances. Speaking of being unlike others on the market, perhaps the most unique feature of our Wool Dryer Balls is their price: we're selling each set of four for $5.49. That's an incredible value; these very same Dryer Balls are sold for two (or three!) times as much elsewhere. You'll find them with our household products. 09.17. 18",

Made for us by a company in Japan who originally used the material to create mosquito netting, each 13.5 inch by 13.5 inch Cloth is made from a blend of 18% cotton and 82% rayon (which is made from wood pulp), the threads of which have been expertly infused with Binchotan Charcoal. Upon first opening the package, you may notice that the dry Cloth is relatively stiff. However, once you give it a quick soak in some warm water, and allow the rayon/cotton blend to absorb a bit, it quickly becomes delightfully soft. In fact, each Cloth will only grow softer with each use, making it a perfect candidate for use as a washcloth or gym towel, as well as being great for the kitchen and other cleaning purposes. In addition to being luxuriously soft, its Binchotan Charcoal infusion helps absorb odors in whatever you're using it on - a trait that's particularly helpful if you happen to use it as a gym towel¿ You might expect to pay top dollar for such luxury and innovation, but at Trader Joes, you can find our Japanese Binchotan Charcoal Infused Cloths for $4.99, every day.

With four sachets ready to relax and soothe, you'll never be able to go back to a \"plainly\" scented fresh linens again. There's nothing like the comfort of wrapping up in a clean, lavender-scented bath sheet on a chilly morning, or curling up in soft, lavender-scented bedsheets after a stressful day. Toss a Lavender Dryer Bag in your dryer and when the buzzer rings, you'll have a basketful of clean laundry teeming with those coveted floral and herbal notes. And after several dryer cycles, you'll have yet another use for these sachets-simply sprinkle the florets on your carpet and vacuum them up for an instant room freshener! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Take a moment to consider the simple, peaceful comforts of lighting a nice scented candle for yourself. Everything from the lighting of the wick, providing both light and a bit of heat, to the time spent in quiet consideration as the fragrance slowly fills the room gives you a pronounced sense of feeling safe and sound at home. Trader Joe's Citronella Candle takes that feeling one step further with an infusion of citronella and lemon eucalyptus oil, two essential oils that provide a remarkably relaxing, citrusy scent, and help keep flying insects at bay. What's more peaceful than that? Each brightly-scented, 9.5-ounce Citronella Candle is made from a blend of soy wax, beeswax, and coconut oil, which is poured into a recyclable, pull-top can and fitted with two cotton wicks. All in all, you should get about 28 hours of burn time from each Candle, a remarkable figure considering our retail of $4.99*. That said, we're only selling these now through the end of summer, so make sure to grab one soon - deals like these tend to burn the wick at both ends, so to speak. While supplies last, you can find Trader Joe's Citronella Candles in our household section, along with our other scented candles. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Citronella Candle",

Which is precisely why we're introducing Trader Joe's Fresh Citrus All Purpose Disinfectant Cleaner to our shelves. Not only does it kill 99.9% of common household bacteria and viruses on all sorts of surfaces, it does so without the use of chlorine bleach, phosphates, or sodium laureth sulfate-and leaves behind a refreshingly sweet Citrus scent, to boot. Made with a 2.4% solution of hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, this Cleaner truly is All Purpose, adept at dealing with everything from tough grease stains in the kitchen, to mold and mildew in the bathroom. An excellent choice for both big projects and everyday tidying-up, all it takes to effectively clean, deodorize, and disinfect is to spray the affected area with Cleaner until thoroughly wet, allow to sit for 20 minutes, then wipe away.

They're made with super premium, food-grade, platinum silicone, which in addition to being the highest quality of silicone available in the U.S., is definitely the silicone with the coolest name available in the U.S. They're microwave, freezer, and dishwasher safe, and each package contains three bags, each in one of three different sizes: small, which can hold up to 8.45 fluid ounces in volume (enough to hold a couple servings of trail mix), medium, which can hold up to 23.67 fluid ounces (enough to hold a well-stacked sandwich) and large, which holds up to 33.81 fluid ounces (enough to hold roughly 3-4 slices of pizza). Super functional (and, if you ask us, rather fashionable), these Reusable Bags improve on their single-use counterparts in practically every way: they're super durable, they zip open and closed like a dream, and they even stand up on their own for ease of filling. In short, they're great for storing everything from leftovers to pre-prepped ingredients, school lunches, and afternoon snacks.

So why not make the job a little simpler with Trader Joe's Automatic Dishwasher Detergent Packs? Proudly available in plastic-free packaging, our convenient, single-use Dishwasher Detergent Packs employ the power of potent enzymes like protease and amylase, as well as plant- based surfactants like corn-derived caprylyl/capyrl glucoside, to leave all kinds of dishwasher-safe kitchenware sparkling and spotless. Use one Detergent Pack for each load of your automatic dishwasher, making sure that your hands are dried off before handling (the wrapper for each Pack is made of a water soluble material, and you won't want them to open up and spill their contents before they're ready!). For best results, we find that turning your dishes so that the soiled side is facing the center of the machine lets the Detergent do its job most efficiently. Lastly, if you're going to be washing aluminum, silver, or stainless steel items, separating them into their own loads will keep them looking their best-a little like doing separate light and dark loads for your laundry.

Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates. What makes a half-gallon of French vanilla ice cream \"French\", you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself (which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream. Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream! We're selling each half-gallon container of French Vanilla Ice Cream for $5.99*.

But at Trader Joe's, we are always interested in improving upon a good thing-so last year, our buyer set out to see if we could \"build a better cone,\" as it were. As it would turn out, we could.

Next, these mini, chocolate-lined treasures are piped full of thick, creamy Vanilla ice cream. The Ice Cream our new vendor makes is so deliciously dense because it contains only around 50% overrun (that's ice cream lingo for the amount of air whipped into the ice cream to expand its volume), which is impressive when you consider that most ice cream used in frozen novelties contains around 90% overrun. Finally, the Cones are dipped-upside down, no less!-in more of that fine, fine chocolate. Snatch a Mini Cone (or three) out of the freezer whenever your sweet tooth calls-at under 100 calories each, they are easily worth the indulgence.

But what does it taste like, you ask? It's creamy. It's sweet. It's nutty. Some liken it to a cross between vanilla and pistachio, with hints of coconut mixed in. And unlike most ube-flavored ice creams, ours contains real ube purée. Trust us, you're gonna like it. Plus, you can rest easy knowing that its purple hue is from naturally derived ingredients like grape extract and beet juice, not artificial dyes. You know what else is naturally derived? The pure joy you'll experience as you sample your first scoop (or polish off your first pint) of Ube Ice Cream.

Rather than traditonal sugar cones, these feature chocolate cones, and rather than a simple, smooth, ice cream filling, these feature ice cream studded with rich chocolate chips. Another Hold the Cone! hallmark are the lined cones. Here, the chocolate cones are lined with the same chocolatey coating that tops the ice cream - that creamy cone-lining not only tastes great, it also keeps the ice cream from leaking out as you enjoy your Mini Cone. Win! These treats, like their relatives in the freezer case, are made exclusively for Trader Joe's, so if it's a Mini Ice Cream Cone fix you desire, a trip to Trader Joe's is the stuff of dreams made real.

We horchatized it by adding cinnamon and brown rice flour, plus a touch of sea salt. And since inclusions are fun, we also added pieces of horchata-flavored cookies, contributing a nice textural variation. Unlike the beverage, you probably won't be having Horchata Ice Cream right alongside your taco plate- though we wouldn't dare stop you!

Normally, Trader Joe's Mango & Cream Bars [sku 92373] (available year-round) would have been part of this polar produce party- except our Australian supplier announced earlier this year that they were unable to keep up, after more than a dozen years of meeting our mango bar demand. Without skipping a beat we sought a new supplier, this time, closer to home. We also took the opportunity to make some minor improvements before presenting our latest Mango Cream Bars. Flavor-wise, these are similar to the previous iteration-a combination of creamy vanilla and sweet-tart mango. What sticks out here as different is... the stick. (Previous version was sans stick.) And rather than the flavors existing side-by-side, in this version, the creamy vanilla ice cream is entirely surrounded by sweet, fruity mango sorbet. It's the same format as our Tangerine Cream Bars, only with Mango. You might also find that Trader Joe's Mango Cream Bars are a bit richer overall. That's because the first ingredient is vanilla ice cream (it was water in the original version).

Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain style-so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice cream. An ice cream that's intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that's wondrously light, yet velvety and dense. An ice cream like Trader Joe's Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato. Like our seasonal Strawberries & Cream Gelato [sku 75375], TJ's Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato is made for us by an Italian supplier using more milk than cream, yielding a lower butterfat content than you'd find in American-style ice cream. This gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality while still remaining delectably smooth and creamy, and allows its Chocolate and Vanilla Bean flavors (courtesy of cocoa, semisweet chocolate, and actual vanilla bean specks) and its sweet, chocolate-sauce Swirl to really shine. Instead of a traditional pint, we've very intentionally packed our Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato in a 1.8-pint (850mL) tub. Peel off the lid, and the Gelato's dazzling peaks and swirls will conjure up all the beautifully decorated, sumptuous ripples you'd find in an authentic, Italian gelateria!

Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates. What makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream \"French\", you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself (which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream. Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream! We're selling each one quart container of French Vanilla Ice Cream for $3.99*.

First and foremost, our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream has very low overrun. Overrun, in ice cream speak, is the amount of air that's whipped into the ice cream - the higher the overrun, the lower quality the ice cream. (This one comes in at 25.56% overrun.) Because there is so little air in this ice cream, it is thicker, richer and creamier than lesser quality ice creams, a direct result of its 15% butterfat content. And then there's the flavor. Big WOW here. Some coffee ice creams have a little coffee flavor - some don't even use actual coffee. Our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream features big, bold, intense coffee flavor that comes from brewed Colombian coffee and bits of very finely ground French Roast Colombian coffee beans in every bite.

Trader Joe's Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches came to fruition some years back, when we had an ice cream epiphany and realized we could do better-way better-than most of the ice cream sandwiches we found in freezers around the country. Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. (Yes, it's a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they'd been frozen), we moved on to the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips. In case you were curious, this is the kind of task we can always be counted on to undertake with vigilance. Not only do these Ice Cream Sandwiches taste Sublime, they're sublimely priced at $4.49 for a package of four (20 ounces).

Trader Joe's, for one, doesn't need fluorescent green coloring to tell you that our Mint Chip Ice Cream is packed with pleasing peppermint flavor and melt-in-your mouth chocolate chips. We love to focus on quality ingredients with all of our products, and Trader Joe's Mint Chip Ice Cream does not deviate. A simple mixture of cream, milk, sugar, egg yolks, fudge chips, peppermint extract, and just two thickening agents make up this decadent dessert, which basically means if we happened to make a batch directly in your home, it'd be as pure as homemade churned ice cream! And notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's Mint Chip Ice Cream has 26% overrun - in other words a dense, super SUPER premium ice cream! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Mint Chip Ice Cream",

It's the food that intrigues us more than anything else France has to offer. Just when you think you have French food all figured out (it's heavy, richly sauced, not so healthful), along comes a French creation that defies all expectation (it's light, great to eat on the go, and loaded with fruit). We're talking about Trader Joe's Fruit Frenzy Bars, the epitome of fresh French, only frozen. Years ago, on a trip to France, our buyers spied some vibrant, multi-colored ice pops. They were intrigued, only to find out that the pops were loaded with artificial flavors and synthetic colors. That didn't stop our intrepid travelers, though. They put out the word and found a supplier to make an exclusive version of these colorful treats just for Trader Joe's. Fruit Frenzy Bars look a bit like our Fruit Floes [sku 08344], but with three colors & flavors per pop instead of one. Each pop features individual strawberry, lemon and raspberry sections - all made using actual fruit, and color boost from turmeric. You'll find each 16-ounce box with four Bars in our freezers. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Fruit Frenzy Bars",

Of course, now we're talking about a product, not a piece of advice. Patently styled after our iconic Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones [skus 57185, 57186, 62834, etc.], which are found in our freezers, these Cone Tips are cookies, not ice cream. In effect, we've removed the entire top portion of the cone (including the ice cream), leaving behind a conical nugget, the crunchiest part or the Waffle Cone, where the seam comes to a point. Their colossal crunch is complemented by a rich filling of smooth, dark chocolate-not unlike what you find at the bottom of our Mini Ice Cream Cones. Another point we'd like to make-and what may really tip the scales for serious serial snackers-is the fact that these Cones Tips require no refrigeration. That's right, they're 100% portable, and ready to eat anytime you need a Tip to top-off a meal, or to counter a savory snack with the crunch of something sweet. One final pointed tip: You'll find Trader Joe's Hold the Cone Tips every day in our stores, stocked with our collection of cookies. Hold the Cone Tips",

Per usual, Trader Joe's is here to make the impossible not only possible, but simple and affordable, too. Presenting our latest grow-it-yourself holiday offering: Paperwhite Bulbs. Native to the western Mediterranean region, Paperwhites are members of the Narcissus family-the daffodil's paler, more fragrant cousin. But unlike some Narcissus varieties, Paperwhites can't tolerate cold weather, so they'll gladly seek refuge from the winter's chill in a cozy, indoor space. No green thumb? No problem. Getting your Bulb to bloom couldn't be easier. Each bulb comes lodged in a slender, 9\" tall, clear Glass Vase and is ready to be taken home (or gifted away) and grown hydroponically, without soil. Place the Vase in a sunny window, add water, and 3 - 5 weeks later, your whole room will smell like sweet, sweet springtime. This holiday season, you won't have to spend a bunch of paper to get a bunch of Paperwhites-we're selling each Paperwhite Bulb in a Glass Vase for $3.99.

Once considered novel and hard to come by, these soil-free, desert gems can now be found sitting pretty in corner cafés, hipster hotels, and stylish sitting rooms all the world over. Heck, at this point, these plants are so popular that even your not-too-trendy Aunt Trudy probably has tillandsia or two. Why all the ado about Air Plants, you ask? Simple: they're easy to grow and almost impossible to kill. Requiring no soil and very little water, Air Plants gather their moisture and nutrients from-you guessed it-the air. They prefer warmer temperatures and indirect light, so they're perfect for folks looking to liven up an indoor environment. At Trader Joe's, they're our go-to plant for fun, kitschy designs. This year, in the wake of our Tillandsias in Ceramic Sugar Skulls' year-over-year popularity, we're offering a new incarnation of the concept: Trader Joe's Tillandsia Ceramic Ornaments. Because why not hang a plant on a tree? It's greenery upon greenery, people! This time, instead of a skull (which wouldn't be very Christmas-y), we've secured a single tillandsia plant atop a red, green, or gold ceramic sphere. Each Ornament features a loop of clear fishing line at the top and a slightly flat impression at the bottom, so you can place your Ornament in your window or hang it on your tree-your choice. Either way, the only thing you have to do to keep your Air Plant alive is dunk it water for about five seconds, twice a week. Easy-peasy. We're selling each Tillandsia (Air Plant) Ornament for $3.99 each, so you can enjoy a little bit of this greenery without spending a whole lot of that greenery. You'll find them in our plants and flowers section, while they last. 11.20.17",

As long as you can follow these instructions, keep a semi-watchful eye on the water level, and remain somewhat patient, your Bulb will produce at least one tall, beautiful Amaryllis stem with multiple large, red blooms in about 6 - 10 weeks. This is the must-have plant of the season. Strikingly presented in a extra-large, reusable glass vase, a Trader Joe's Giant Amaryllis Bulb makes a cheerful, elegant gift for just about anyone on your list. We're selling each Giant Amaryllis Bulb in a Glass Vase for the not-so-flowery price of $9.99, throughout the season. You'll find them in our plants and flowers section. 11.20.17",

There are over 500 different species of Tillandsia, and while they have many common characteristics, they also vary greatly in range, size and needs. They are found throughout southern North America, Central America and South America. Tillandsia are referred to as air plants because of the unique way they grow. Most are epiphytes meaning they grow attached to other plants, such as trees. They are not parasitic as they gather all of their own nutrients and water and cause no harm to their host plants. The plants will need good clean air circulation to survive and live a healthy life. It's important that after watering the plants have enough air circulation to dry within 4 hours. While Air Plants will do well in containers, it is recommended that they do not be displayed in enclosed containers, and that they are completely dry before they are put back into a container that might restrict air circulation. CARE ¿ Water: Mist every 3 days or soak in water weekly. ¿ Light: Place the plant in bright but indirect light. ¿ Temperature: Performs well at an average indoor temperature (65-75°F). ¿ Fertilizer: Bromeliad fertilizer can be used monthly in small quantities ¿ Continuing Care: Trim off yellow leaves",

These spring- flowering bulbs put forth a bold burst of color that lasts for about two weeks--and better yet, they're delightfully scented. Most hyacinth bulbs for indoor use are forced to flower; this means they're chilled for a period of time to mimic the conditions of overwintering, which stimulates them to produce blooms. If you buy naked bulbs, as opposed to blooming plants, you'll have to provide several months of chilling to coax the flowers out. Growing Conditions ¿ Light: Bright ¿ Water: Keep the potting media lightly wet, but not soaked. Overwatering can cause root rot. If you're growing your hyacinth in water, as in a decorative vase, only let the roots dangle into the water. ¿ Temperature: Keep hyacinth plants cool during the growing season to prolong the bloom. Recommend temperatures range from about 45 degrees F to 65 degrees F. https://www.thespruce.com/planting-bulbs-in-a-lawn-1402230 https://www.thespruce.com/planting-bulbs-in-a-lawn-1402230",

In that spirit, we're introducing Trader Joe's Chicken Flavor Instant Ramen Soup, the perfect bridge between the convenience of instant ramen and the expansive flavors and aromas of a noodle shop shoyu bowl. What truly sets our Chicken Flavor Ramen Soup apart from other instant ramens, aside from its impeccably crafted blend of seasonings, is the inclusion of a packet of blended sunflower and sesame oil. By adding both the packet of seasonings and the packet of oil to your cup of dry noodles before preparation, you ensure not only a delightfully savory broth, rich with flavors of chicken stock, garlic, onion, and soy sauce, but a silky-smooth texture for your noodles-the days of dry-textured instant noodles are over. From there, it's simply a matter of either adding boiling water up to the cup's fill line (or adding room temperature water up to the fill line and microwaving the entire cup for one minute, 30 seconds), stirring, and letting it sit for about six minutes before serving. Whether served straight out of the cup for a quick lunch, or transferred to a bowl with a few more traditional fixings (we recommend adding a few slices of Pork Tenderloin [SKU 51195] and a few shredded Roasted Seaweed Strips [sku 92743 or 62584]), Trader Joe's Chicken Flavor Ramen Soup will deliver a ramen house experience at a student-housing price-$1.29 per 1.5-ounce cup, to be exact.

From there, it's simply a matter of either adding boiling water up to the cup's fill line (or adding room temperature water up to the fill line and microwaving the entire cup for one minute, 30 seconds), stirring, and letting it sit for about six minutes before serving. Whether served straight out of the cup for a quick lunch, or transferred to a bowl with a few more traditional fixings (we recommend adding a few slices Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu [sku 56423] and a few shredded Roast- ed Seaweed Strips [sku 92743 or 62584]), Trader Joe's Miso Ramen Soup will deliver a ramen house experience at a student-housing price-$1.29 per 1.5-ounce cup, to be exact.

   "description": "It's generally a smart idea to keep some noodles in your pantry. But if they're fully-cooked, ready-to-eat, and shelf-stable, too? Now that's really using your noodle. That's precisely the promise of Trader Joe's Thai Wheat Noodles, a three-pack of ready-to-use noodle packets that's as simple to eat as heat, serve, and enjoy. They're made for us, by scratch, by a supplier in Thailand, who cooks them to soft, chewy perfection, then vacuum- seals them to keep them preserved at room temperature until the very moment you need them for a soup, curry, or stir-fry. We're not kidding about the convenience factor on these Noodles: simply open up a packet, mix it into your dish, and you're good to go. Without all that extra time boiling and draining dried noodles, you can afford to experiment with oodles of other ingredients, like a chow-mein inspired stir fry spiced with Chili Onion Crunch [sku 62480], a cold noodle bowl flavored with sesame seeds and Crunchy Peanut Butter [sku 01488], or a savory soup spiked with Thai Style Red Curry Sauce [sku 57474]. When you're ready to explore, check out our 21-ounce boxes of Thai Wheat Noodles, each containing three 7-oz. packs of Noodles.

   "description": "Broadly speaking, ramen can be categorized into one of two types: the kind you get a big, steaming bowl of at a restaurant, and the kind you make at home with a kettle of hot water or a microwave. Trader Joe's Spicy Miso Instant Ramen is our humble endeavor to merge these two categories. What's our secret? In addition to the noodles and packet of delightfully savory seasonings, each 1.76-ounce Ramen Soup cup includes a packet of blended sunflower and toasted sesame oil, which gives the noodles a fine, silky texture that's normally exclusive to ramen found in noodle shops. In fact, we drew direct inspiration from the hot and spicy options at most noodle shops for our vegan Spicy Miso flavor. Once mixed with hot water, the included seasoning packet creates a rich, savory, and pleasantly spicy broth - one that's hot enough to satisfy most heat-seekers out there, but not so hot as to turn away those with milder tastes. We like to dress ours up simply, with a quick garnish of seaweed, scallions, or cilantro, but you could certainly go all out and add some protein with a soft-boiled egg, marinated tofu, or even some roasted pork, if you'd like. However you go about it, Trader Joe's Spicy Miso Instant Ramen is quick, convenient, and top quality, while also remaining a real value at $1.49* per cup.

That moment sparked some inspiration, leading Gary to innovate in his mother's kitchen and create the very first Clif Bar. Trader Joe's understands the Clif Bar story. It is one of opportunity, inspiration, and innovation - three words we embrace as we search for and develop our own products. This resonance, plus the broad popularity of Clif Bars, is why we've carried a wide variety of their bars for a long time. We've been carrying their Chocolate Chip Clif Bar since the near-conception of the company. It brings to mind the smell and taste of fresh, warm chocolate chip cookies straight out of the oven. Like all their original Clif Bars, this one is crafted for sustained energy with 100% organic rolled oats and chocolate chips. In particular, this Chocolate Chip Clif Bar is a good source of protein at 9g per bar, and a good source of dietary fiber at 4g per bar. It contains only 4.5g total fat and 0g trans fat, with no partially-hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors or synthetic preservatives.

Or at least that's what Think!® founder Lizanne Falsetto found herself bumping up against some 20+ years ago, when, in simply tinkering with protein bar recipes in her home kitchen, she laid the groundwork to become a future wellness phenomenon. A single mother and former fashion model, Lizanne knew there had to be a \"better bar\" for busy folks. One with plenty of protein. One without sugar, gluten (which Lizanne is allergic to), or genetically modified ingredients. And, most importantly, one that didn't taste like some wretched amalgamation of sawdust and cardboard. The Think!® High Protein Bar is that bar, and we're pleased to offer the Creamy Peanut Butter flavor in our stores. Soft and chewy, these whey-and-soy-based Protein Bars bars boast a smooth, peanut-butter interior and a chocolate-dipped exterior.

One bite into a Cranberry Orange Beet Pro Bar, though, and you'll be blown away.

That's why we love Power Crunch Bars so much: these light, crispy Bars offer a potent punch of candy-like flavor in addition to a sizable 13 grams of protein per serving. Power Crunch Triple Chocolate Bars, in particular, deliver that protein between three layers of chocolate surrounding crunchy wafer cookies. Perfectly proportioned for prime portability, Power Crunch Triple Chocolate Bars fit smartly in your gym bag or purse, making them ideal for taking pre- or post-workout. With their remarkably chocolate-y flavor and captivating crunch, though, you might just prefer to keep them on hand for snacking purposes - which makes the fact that each Bar only has five grams of sugar all the sweeter. And then, of course, there's the price: other retailers may sell Power Crunch Bars for two dollars and up, but at Trader Joe's, you can find individual Power Crunch Triple Chocolate Bars for $1.49, every day.

That moment sparked some inspiration, leading Gary to innovate in his mother's kitchen and create the very first Clif Bar. Trader Joe's understands the Clif Bar story. It is one of opportunity, inspiration, and innovation - three words we embrace as we search for and develop our own products. This resonance, plus the broad popularity of Clif Bars, is why we've carried a wide variety of their bars for a long time. We've been carrying their Chocolate Chip Clif Bar since the near-conception of the company. It brings to mind the smell and taste of fresh, warm chocolate chip cookies straight out of the oven. Like all their original Clif Bars, this one is crafted for sustained energy with 100% organic rolled oats and chocolate chips. In particular, this Chocolate Chip Clif Bar is a good source of protein at 9g per bar, and a good source of dietary fiber at 4g per bar. It contains only 4.5g total fat and 0g trans fat, with no partially-hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors or synthetic preservatives.

And then, of course, there's the price: other retailers may sell Power Crunch Bars for two dollars and up, but at Trader Joe's, you can find individual Power Crunch Triple Chocolate Bars for $1.49, every day. Talk about practical! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Power Crunch Protein Energy Bar Triple Chocolate",

If you want phenomenal chocolate milk, though, you need to go all out. And all out we went with Trader Joe's Chocolate Whole Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa. We did not source this Chocolate Whole Milk from chocolate cows. (If only they existed¿) Instead, we started by sourcing fair trade cocoa from small family farms in Northern Peru. This cocoa is then mixed with whole milk and cane sugar. The resulting concoction is what you'll find in the charming cartons of Chocolate Whole Milk. It's truly the most rich, creamy, dreamy Chocolate Milk we could find. In a glass with a straw. Blended with Golden Caramel Swirl Ice Cream [sku 96760] into a milkshake. With Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies [sku 10727] for dessert before bed. Don't ask us to pick a favorite way to enjoy this Chocolate Whole Milk-they're all the best. Someday, there might be chocolate cows that produce the most delicious, rich chocolate milk. Until that day comes, you can enjoy Trader Joe's Chocolate Whole Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa. Each half gallon (64 fluid ounce carton) is $3.99, every day. 03.01. 18",

The unique story behind the cows that produce Trader Joe's Organic Whole Milk from Grass Fed Cows is that they hail from a lush, expansive Colorado farm, where they spend a minimum of 150 days out of the year freely grazing upon organic pastures. During that time, foraged grass is obviously the main thing on the menu, not grains or grain byproducts. (And these cows never receive any hormones or antibiotics-that's true 365 days per year, per organic standards!) Now that you now the story behind your glass of Milk, let's talk about the Milk in your glass¿ Our Grade-A, USDA-certified Organic Milk from Grass Fed Cows is filtered, homogenized, and ultra-pasteurized (held at high temperature for a short time), and contains added Vitamin D3. Beyond all these terrific technical traits, its flavor is also rather special. At 3.5% milkfat, it's thick, creamy, and smooth, with an almost buttery taste. It's perfect for drinking chilled & \"straight up,\" but it's equally suited to star in many other milk moments. Take your cup of TJ's coffee to another silky, milky level. Buoy up your bowl of TJ's Organic Corn Flakes [sku 92331]. Add a splash to scrambled eggs or pancake batter for some added final fluff.

More specifically, mint gum that's available for sale at their local Trader Joe's. So, when the folks at Velamints¿ (whose Blood Orange [sku 56778], Mango [sku 57378], and Coconut Lime [sku 58623] Sugar Free Mints have all been well-received in our stores this year) asked us if we would be interested in carrying their Peppermint Gum, we saw an opportunity to fulfill a long-standing customer request. In the words of Marie Antoinette, \"Let them chew gum*¿\" Velamints¿ Peppermint Gum isn't just any peppermint gum-it's kind of like a mint n' gum sandwich. Actually, it is a mint n' gum sandwich: squares of pleasantly pepperminty, satisfyingly sweet chewing gum positioned between a carefully bisected Velamints¿ classic peppermint. Is it gum? Is it a mint? It's both! And it's sugar free, to boot. Your dentist would surely approve. Pop a piece of Velamints¿ Peppermint Gum whenever you need fresher breath or a minty pick-me-up. It comes in a slim, durable tin, so you can carry it in your purse (or on your person) at all times. If you feel like sharing, circulate a tin around your dinner party after serving up a veggie platter replete with TJ's Roasted Garlic Hummus [sku 29911] and TJ's Garlic Spread-Dip [sku 54173]-your guests will take the hint. We're selling each 1.12 ounce tin (that's 16 pieces) of Velamints¿ Peppermint Gum for $1.99. Currently, this gum isn't available at any other U.S. retailers-so snag a tin today and enjoy your moment as a member of the chewing gum elite! (*Not quite what she said-but close.) 10.10. 16",

This may not come as a surprise, but at Trader Joe's, we also have a penchant for all things tropical-so, really, Velamints¿ Coconut Lime Sugar Free Mints just make sense to us. A product that creates both fresh breath and a tropical oasis in your mouth? We're all about it! And, if the back-to-back successes of Velamints¿ Coconut Lime Sugar Free Mints' predecessors-Blood Orange [sku 56778] and Mango [sku 57378]-are any indication, we think our customers will be all about these Mints, too. Distinctly coconutty with a splash of lime and a hint of mint, Velamints¿ Coconut Lime Sugar Free Mints are both minty and fruity. They are sweetened with Truvia¿ Natural Sweetener rather than sugar (or aspartame), so in addition to freshening your breath, Velamints¿ satisfy a passing sweet tooth without all the calories of a heavier indulgence. And if that wasn't enough, they happen to come in a pretty darn cute, collectable tin to boot. There is no wrong time to enjoy Velamints¿ Coconut Lime Sugar Free Mints, but they do come in particularly handy after polishing off a tub of our TJ's Mediterranean Hummus [sku 90642], or a generous piece of our new TJ's Tarte à l'Oignon [sku 55316]. You can even use these little gems to win friends and influence people; After all, nothing sparks up a conversation or inspires confidence in your abilities quite like, \"Care for a mint?\" Like the Velamints¿ flavors that graced our shelves before them, Velamints¿ Coconut Lime Sugar Free Mints are only available for a limited time, so snag a tin while you can.

   "description": "Fans of medieval literature are familiar with the sign that appears above the entrance to Hell in Dante Alighieri's Inferno: \"All hope abandon, ye who enter here!\" What most Dante fans don't know is that the inspiration for this sign was the real-life notice posted above the entrance to the lavatory in the author's Florentine flat. You see, Dante was horribly lactose intolerant. Lucky for him, a non-dairy \"milk\" made from almonds and water had become wildly popular across much of medieval Europe. Today, the average Trader Joe's customer-not being that different from the typical medieval shopper (except, perhaps, in the tendency to bathe more frequently)-is naturally a fan of almond beverages. In fact, our refrigerated versions have been so favored of late, we've decided it's nigh time we offered a shelf-stable version. Trader Joe's Unsweetened Original Almond Beverage is made by mixing crushed almonds with water and straining the liquid-just as they would have in the Middle Ages (except that our almonds are exclusively from California). The smooth, creamy, slightly-nutty, slightly-sweet \"milk\" that results has no added sugar, and is free of lactose, cholesterol, soy, and gluten. It's also entirely vegan, kosher certified, and fortified with calcium, and vitamins D & E. Best of all, it can be enjoyed all the same ways one would enjoy cow's milk. When it comes to quality products at low prices, other retail grocers might as well have \"All hope abandon, ye who enter here!\" above their door. But, Trader Joe's aims to provide heavenly values in an environment where you'd be willing to spend eternity-or at least long enough to complete your shopping list. In that spirit, our 32 fluid-ounce, shelf-stable Unsweetened Original Almond Beverage is $1.79-a hopeful value, to say the least! 2.17.1 5",

   "description": "Why have one nut when you can have three? This question, posed by one of our intrepid Product Developers, was the driving force that spurred her to seek out a nut-based beverage for the ages-one that would rise above the rest, the creamiest, dreamiest, nut-based beverage on the market. (It may sound dramatic, but we're serious about nut beverages around here.) Thankfully, her tireless tasting efforts paid off, in the form of Trader Joe's Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia Nut Beverage. Our supplier has packed not one, but three different types of Nuts into this Beverage: fragrant Almond, buttery Cashew, and creamy Macadamia. A touch of sea salt is added to enhance these inherently nutty flavors. Free of dairy, gluten, lactose, and soy, this vegan, kosher-certified Beverage also happens to be incredibly tasty. And each one-cup serving clocks in at just 30 calories and 120 milligrams of sodium! To experience the best this Nut Beverage has to offer, we recommend chilling it, and giving the container a good shake before serving. Come to think of it, it would be delicious in a shake, with TJ's Chocolate Ice Cream [sku 78572]. Or use it in place of water when whipping up a batch of Toasted Coconut Pancakes [sku 53170]. The usual suspects (cereal, oatmeal, baked goods, et al.) would get a beneficial, non-dairy boost from the nutty flavors of this Beverage, no doubt. What's almost as nutty as Trader Joe's Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia Nut Beverage? The price. We're selling 32-fluid ounce containers for the WOW value of $2.29, everyday.

We particularly like it as a vegan alternative for using in cereal, baking, or for giving smoothies a nice, creamy quality. And for extra convenience, we offer Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Rice Drink in a Half-Gallon (64 fl. ounces) size. Keep an eye out for it in our non-dairy, shelf stable beverage section for $3.49*. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Organic Unsweetened Rice Drink 1/2 Gallon",

Looking for a smooth and mild Non-Dairy Beverage with a little extra kick of plant-based protein (nine grams per serving, to be precise)? Behold! Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Soy Beverage is your Non-Dairy dream come true. Originally discovered in Japan as a by-product of tofu manufacturing, soy beverage-a.k.a. soy \"milk\"-first rose to stateside prominance in the 1930s, and by the mid-1990s, it had made its way into the hearts and carts of dairy-dodgers everywhere. To this day, our Organic Unsweetened Soy Beverage remains one of the most beloved Beverages in our stores, thanks to its mild flavor and textural similarity to cow's milk.

For nearly 100 years, they have made a commitment to take special care in every step of the almond innovating process. With 3,000 almond growers, raw almonds are transformed in all sorts of shapes and forms, including our personal favorite, Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Breeze. It doesn't stop there - the almond milk undergoes rigorous quality assessments and food safety procedures, so when you take a sip of Almond Breeze, you'll taste nothing but quality (and almonds of course). Not only are Almonds yummy, and a great alternative to milk, they are good health in a nutshell. This dairy free option is low in glycemic index, high in calcium, Vitamin A, D, and E and only 30 calories per cup. Blue Diamond Almond Breeze tastes great in cereal, coffee, and in a glass with some cookies. Take 5 minutes to make overnight oats with our Rolled Oats [sku 95764], Chia Seeds [sku 54256], sprinkles of cinnamon, and slices of strawberries and bananas - drizzle honey or agave to sweeten.

We are most definitely living in the age of the co- conut, a time when we've come to appreciate the embarrassment of riches found within each humble fruit of the coconut palm. From coconut oil to coconut flour, and coconut milk to Trader Joe's Coconut Creamer, the unassuming coconut just keeps giving. And we like it. Make Trader Joe's Coconut Creamer your go-to coconut condiment for coffee or tea. It pours smooth and creamy from the carton, and brings with it just a hint of coconut flavor. Unlike some non-dairy creamers, this one is milky white (rather than gray-ish) and won't separate or curdle when you pour it into a cup of hot coffee or tea. It also has the benefit of lauric acid, a medium chain fatty acid found in coconut-we're no scientists (though we love science!), but scientific studies do suggest that lauric acid can help boost immune function, and really, everybody's in favor of increased immune function! Though it's called \"creamer,\" Coconut Creamer isn't just for coffee and tea-though it's excellent in a cup of Chai Tea Latte [sku 29823] or Cold Brew [sku 50759].

Simply put, fruit curds are a category of preserves in a class of their own, made by cooking fruit juice with eggs and butter. Typically served with scones or bread as an alternative to jam, fruit curds are woven into British teatime tradition-which is why our Buyer went straight to the source to develop Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd. Our Authentic Lemon Curd is imported from England, where it's been made exclusively for us for nearly 15 years. Cane sugar, whole eggs, and butter are slow-cooked in small batches with Sicilian lemon juice concentrate, lemon oil, and pectin; because the characteristics of the lemon juice can vary slightly from batch to batch, this labor-intensive process is overseen by a kettle master, whose sole purpose is to stir the curd and monitor its flavor, satiny texture, and vibrant sheen until it's just right. When the mixture cools, it transforms into a luxuriously thick, glossy, golden-yellow spread, imbued with the aroma of freshly baked lemon bars. Yum¿ With flavors of rich butter and sweet sugar contrasted by bright, tangy lemon, you might refer to our Lemon Curd as \"sunshine in a jar.\" After all, a spoonful of the stuff has the power to brighten up breakfast, baked goods, and all sorts of sweets and treats in between. Slather it on toast or stir it into yogurt. Drizzle it on pancakes, or ice cream, or cheesecake. If you want to get fancy, whip up some heavy cream and fold it into the Lemon Curd for an almost-effortless tart or layer cake filling worthy of a royal afternoon tea. We're offering 10.5-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd for the sunny price of $2.99 each. Find them on our grocery shelves.",

Now, because our customers have been clambering, the odd man out is coming in. That is to say, we are bringing in Trader Joe's Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter to round out our offering. Like its siblings, Trader Joe's Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter is crafted for us in Washington by nut butter masters (they've been in the business for more than 30 years). Their secret: premium, dry roasted, California- grown almonds. The sweet richness of the nuts is revealed in the roasting. Then they're expertly ground into a creamy paste and mixed together with pieces of almond to add that dynamic, crave-able crunch. The only other ingredient that comes into play is salt, which subtly bolsters the almond flavor. Its simplicity speaks to the caliber. Trader Joe's Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter is low in sodium; cholesterol free; and a good source of fiber and protein. Plus, it comes packaged in plastic, BPA-free jars, which are desirably light, less inclined to break, and readily recyclable.

Depending on dialect, tahini (or tahina) comes from the Arabic verb \"to grind.\" That is an accurate description of what's packed into our jars of Trader Joe's Organic Tahini; simply ground, hulled sesame seeds. This savory sauce is made in Greece with premium organic sesame seeds that are gently ground in a stone mill. One of the thankworthy things about this creation is the ingredients list: It isn't a thousand-word essay with complicated chemistry, but one simple ingredient. Our Organic Tahini is seemingly a super-food. It is a good source of minerals (magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and manganese). It also contains amino acids, omega-3, and omega-6 fatty acids. Presenting an obliging roasted, rich flavor, the creamy, smooth sauce will pair amiably with Middle Eastern dishes. But don't stop there! There's a laundry (or grocery) list of combinations to attempt. Dress up some Mediterranean Hummus [sku 90642] by mixing it in. Or, dip our meatless Falafel [sku 93935] in it. You can also make your own hummus by blending a 1/4 cup Tahini with a can of Garbanzo Beans [sku 50261], one garlic clove, one TBSP lemon juice, and EVOO and seasoning to taste. Serve as an appetizer, and dive vegetables or pita bread into your enticing mixture. Watch out! This friendly-for-all kosher, vegan food might quickly turn into a free-for-all.

And we sell a variety-creamy, crunchy, organic, conventional, with salt, without salt¿ you get the idea. One option we haven't had is a no-stir variety. Our peanut butters have always been minimalist: peanuts and salt (or not), without anything added. Because of this, they all have oils that separate from the actual peanut butter, and require stirring to recombine the oil with the peanut butter. We know people are okay with this sce- nario, because as we said, we sell a lot of peanut butter. But¿ we heard from a good number of customers that they'd really like a peanut butter that didn't require them to stir, and they'd like it to be made with the same quality ingredients we use in our other products-in other words, they didn't want high fructose corn syrup or partially hydrogenated oils in the mix. So we rolled up our sleeves and set to work with a trusted peanut butter supplier, and by George we think we've done it! Trader Joe's Creamy No-Stir Peanut Butter Spread is the result of that sleeve-rolling and-full disclosure again-spoon dipping. It's made with simple ingredients-just a few more of them than you'll find in the \"Need to Stir\" va- rieties. Each jar has peanuts (ground to a creamy consistency), palm oil, a little cane sugar, and a pinch of salt. The oil and sugar help to keep the natural oils from separating, making it possible to open a jar of our No-Stir Peanut Butter, stick a spoon right in, and enjoy the rich, peanutty taste of good quality PB, no stirring required.

They were not toasted, roasted, or even \"lightly dried\" (which would basically amount to roasting). No cooking, no roasting, no drying, no salt, no added oils¿ no nothing. Or, more accurately, \"no something.\" But, don't be confused. They are something. They are simply the finest almonds California has to offer, gently ground into a creamy, spreadable nut topping suitable for dressing up toast, muffins, bagels, celery sticks¿ just about anything other nude food that could benefit from a flavorful layer of Raw Creamy Almond Butter. What we're trying to say here is that if you are looking for a nutt-naked spread with uninhibited flavor, you are going to find it right here inside our sixteen-ounce jar of Trader Joe's Raw Creamy Almond Butter. That jar is $7.99, and can be found on our grocery shelves, next to our modest collection of nut butters-the ones that are also very good, though slightly more self-conscious. 4.30.1 5",

While blooming sunflowers are best enjoyed mid to late summertime, our creamy Sunflower Seed Butter is available to enjoy all year round! Our supplier takes sunflower kernels (of a specially selected Midwestern variety) and dry roasts them to enhance their natural flavor. The seeds are then crushed and mixed with just two ingredients-evaporated cane sugar and salt-until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy Seed Butter. You'll love this Sunflower Seed Butter for its fresh-roasted aroma and \"nutty\" flavor. You may also appreciate that it is 100% nut-free, with zero trans fats. Experience it spread on Trader Joe's Organic Whole Wheat Bread [sku 64956 & various], or on the ribs of our Organic Celery Hearts [sku 64027].

That might partially explain why the members of our tasting panel were so utterly swept off their feet when they tried our Organic Apricot Preserves. Made with organic apricots and organic cane sugar, these Preserves couple the uniquely sweet and delicately tart flavor of its star stonefruit with a charmingly chunky texture that's ideal for spreading over toast, muffins, or freshly made pancakes. Altogether, it's a jam that's so joyfully juicy that it might just make you see the world through apricot-colored glasses. An able companion for all kinds of breakfast-y baked goods, Trader Joe's Organic Apricot Preserves also serve splendidly in a savory context. We're particularly fond of them as an accompaniment to a cheese board, especially when lightly spread over a rich, full-flavored cheese like Roquefort [sku 89767], or mixed with creamy Chevre [sku 19751].

We don't know for certain how many ages and won't hazard a guess (we just know it's been a while), but one thing we do know for certain is that our customers love their oatmeal. Recently, however, our customers brought to our attention a glaring oversight: while we offer a fun array of year- round and seasonal instant oatmeal, we've never had an unsweetened variety. Give us a blank breakfast canvas, they said, Let us be the masters of our own breakfast destiny! Our mission was clear, and so the journey to Trader Joe's Unsweetened Instant Oatmeal began. During the development process, our buyers decided that, while \"plain,\" our Unsweetened Instant Oatmeal should have a bit of flair-which ultimately came in the form of ground flax seeds, chia seeds, quinoa, and ama- ranth. When combined with a base of whole grain oats, the result is a rich, hearty oatmeal that also happens to be gluten free and nutritionally impressive: each 160 calorie, 1.4 ounce packet of oatmeal contains 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein. Since Trader Joe's Unsweetened Instant Oatmeal is, in fact, the 'blank breakfast canvas' our customers were clamoring for, you can dress it up to your heart's desire. Mix in fresh fruit, freeze-dried fruit, honey, agave, co- conut oil, milk, almond butter, peanut butter-you name it. One of our buyers had a stroke of genius and threw in some TJ's Black Forest Bacon [sku 50207] (cooked, of course) and added a drizzle of TJ's Maple Syrup [sku 04892]. Heavenly, she said.

Our supplier harvests the olives by hand at peak harvest time, and then pits them. Rather than jarring and brining them, our vendor simply seasons them lightly with sea salt and packs them into two-serving pouches. These handy packs are the perfect size for snacking, and they eliminate the need for cracking open a huge jar. Stash these olives for unforeseen olive cravings. Use the perfectly portioned packs for cooking or cocktails. However you enjoy them, Trader Joe's Just a Handful of Pitted Salted Manzanilla Olives will prove to be tasty, convenient, and a great value at just $0.99 per 1.05 ounce package (ten olives). Find them on our grocery aisle, with our jarred olives.",

   "description": "Almost all olives must go through a curing process before they're edible. Fresh, right-off-the-tree olives are full of an extremely bitter-tasting compound called oleuropein, which can be removed by submerging them in various kinds of solutions, or even just packing them in salt, for an extended period of time. In some cases, olive farmers prefer to \"crack\" their olives prior to curing, by smashing them just enough to allow the pit to be removed. These cracked olives, or olive schiacciate, as they're known in Italy, absorb more brine than an intact olive as they cure, developing a deeper flavor and softer texture. And when combined with a mix of pickled veggies, capers, and savory seasonings, as they are in Trader Joe's Cracked Olive Salad, they're nothing short of a cracking good time. Equally able as an appetizer, condiment, or side, each jar of Trader Joe's Cracked Olive Salad is made with both green cracked olives and black pitted olives, capers, and a giardiniera-like mix of pickled cauliflower, carrots, celery, and red peppers, all suspended in oil that's been seasoned with herbs like oregano and parsley. It makes a great topping for an Italian beef or muffaletta sandwich, a terrific topping for practically any style of pizza, and serves spectacularly well with a charcuterie board or cheese plate.

   "description": "Olives truly are one of the most fascinating fruits on the planet. Depending on the variety, they can have a near endlessly wide variety of flavors, ranging from peppery to nutty, grassy to tart, and everything in between. Some varieties, like Chalkidiki olives from Greece, have a buttery, savory flavor and firm texture that some describe as \"meaty.\" Here's where things get really fascinating: as it turns out, one of the best ways to bring olives with that flavor/texture combo to their fullest expression is to grill them, more or less like you would meat on a skewer. And that's precisely what's been done to Trader Joe's Grilled Pitted Green Olives. They're made for us by a supplier in Greece, who grows their own Chalkidiki olives in groves right by their packing facilities. After curing the Olives, they pit them, then place them on a hot grill until distinct, lined sear marks develop. These sear marks not only provide a nice bit of texture to each olive, but develop a deep, warm, Maillard reaction-based savoriness, too. A fascinating preparation for an already fascinating fruit, Trader Joe's Grilled Pitted Green Olives are superb as a standalone snack, a great option for garnishing salads, sandwiches, and savory cocktails, and a smart choice for cheese platters, antipasto plates, and charcuterie boards.

While not wanting to take anything away from Croatian culture, we think it's important to recognize that Farfalle, the pasta shape that looks like a bow tie, was invented in Northern Italy about a hundred years before anyone thought to tie a scarf into a bow around his neck. Sure, Farfalle translates to \"butterflies,\" and they do in fact look like little butterflies as well, but when was the last time you heard anyone refer to them as \"butterfly pasta\"? Trader Joe's Farfalle is made for us by one of the most renowned pasta makers in Italy, using a specific variety of wheat that's grown only in Southern Italy. In fact, in accordance with Italian tradition, there are only two ingredients in the pasta - durum semolina flour and water. The texture of Farfalle makes it a winner in both hot and cold preparations.

Nutritionally, what these bean-based pastas offer is almost astonishing. This one, made with a single ingredient (organic red lentil flour), is packed with 13 grams of protein in every serving. That's impressive. And delicious. Pair it with our Organic Tomato Basil Marinara [10111] or a simple blend of olive oil, garlic, and grated cheese. If you're looking to change up your pasta patterns, this is a good place to start. We're selling each 12 ounce bag of gluten free Organic Red Lentil Sedanini, imported from Italy, for $2.99, every day. You'll find it in our grocery aisle. 02.01. 17",

   "description": "Bari is the capital of southern Italy's Puglia region - geographically, the top of the heel of the boot - and also the birthplace of our new lineup of Organic Italian Artisan Pastas. Does one need to travel to the eastern reaches of the Italian peninsula to find pasta? Of course not. But our product development team is not in the business of need; no, they're in the business of must have. And really, after a single bite of this extraordinary pasta, we realized this (and its partners) was a Trader Joe's must have. Traditional Italian pasta is made with only two ingredients, durum wheat semolina flour and water - a small amount of softer wheat flour is allowed by law, but Trader Joe's Organic Italian Artisan Gigli Pasta is crafted with 100% organic durum wheat semolina sourced from farms in Puglia. Our supplier has been producing artisan-made pasta for more than 35 years. Most dried pasta (including our 99¢ Italian offerings) are made in huge batches and dried quickly, from three to 12 hours. This Artisan Pasta is made in small batches, and dried at much lower temperatures for up to 24 hours, resulting in a more rustic texture that cooks to a de- lightfully al dente texture. Gigli, also known as Campanelle (translates to \"bellflowers\" or \"little bells\"), has a ruffled edge and hollow center, so it holds any sauce extremely well. Marinara? Carbonara? Just a bit of olive oil and shaved Parmesan? Any of these will do, deliciously. We're selling each 17.6 ounce bag of Organic Italian Artisan Gigli Pasta for $2.69, a delicious value you'll find only at Trader Joe's. You'll find it in our grocery section, alongside our other pastas. 01.01. 18",

Sure, there may have been some options when it came to cut - spaghetti, linguine, penne, fettuccine - but pasta was pasta. Man, we don't miss those days at all. The 21st century has brought about a pasta renaissance, giving rise to seemingly countless iterations of these noble noodles. This revival has opened up our eyes and our taste buds to pasta's possibilities, including those delivered within each package of Trader Joe's Organic Yellow Lentil & Brown Rice Spaghetti. We took inspiration from our Red Lentil Sedanini pasta, a short cut that has proven quite popular in pasta circles. Here, we've developed a classic, long cut Spaghetti, and blended 90% organic yellow lentils with 10% organic brown rice (without the brown rice, the bean-based pasta doesn't hold its shape in this longer cut). With 14 grams of protein per serving, this is a satisfying gluten free option you can enjoy with any of your favorite pasta sauces, or even a simple drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, salt & pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Try it tossed with chopped fresh tomatoes, asparagus, and grilled shrimp or chicken for a real treat! We're selling Organic Yellow Lentil & Brown Rice Spaghetti, made in a certified gluten free facility in Italy, in a 12 ounce package for the everyday price of $2.99.

It's made with nothing but organic brown rice and water so that what you're unpacking is pure, natural, and delicious. These two simple ingredients are unified in holy marinara-matrimony to be served hot with tomato sauce and freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano [sku 46837], cold with fresh veggies in a gluten-free pasta salad, or anywhere you'd typically go about using your favorite pasta. Did we mention one of the greatest benefits of that simple ingredient list? Both ingredients are gluten free, effectively making our Organic Brown Rice Penne Pasta a delicious, organic option for those who steer away from gluten products. Penne is one of those odd culinary classics that has a definitive birthday. A pasta maker in Genoa unleashed a pasta cutting machine in 1865 that created little pen shaped noodles. And as a hollow, tubular shape with external ridges, it's chock full of surface area that helps each piece of pasta hold onto any number of the flavorful sauces you're bound to find on the shelves next to each one-pound bag of Organic Brown Rice Penne Pasta. In just about ten minutes, you can be enjoying a bowl of Trader Joe's Organic Brown Rice Penne Pasta. And for only $1.99* a pound? Sounds like dinner has been decided!

In addition to selling a variety of wheat-based pastas, we also carry numerous noodles made from alternative ingredients. For instance, we sell Organic Red Lentil Sedanini [sku 58259], and Organic Brown Rice Penne [sku 64058], to name just a couple options. For our latest non-traditional noodle, we've taken a break from the legumes and alternate grains and gone for something we think is truly unique: Trader Joe's Hearts of Palm Pasta! Tender, mild-tasting, hearts of palm come from the center of palm trees. Our Ecuadorian supplier takes special care to use only palms that have been cultivated specifically for heart harvesting. With their sustainable process, the palms are not cut down, which avoids endangering the trees. Harvested Hearts are cut into thin, white strands, using a special process. Nothing is added to this mild- flavored Pasta, which means it's ideal for heating and tossing with a variety of different sauces. Go Italian with some marinara or take things in an Asian direction by making Palm Hearts Pad Thai.

These noodles make the most of their uncomplicated flavor profile, allowing the stronger flavors the sauces that typically accompany them to shine through. But making pappardelle from scratch can be a drawn-out, labor-intensive affair. That's precisely where Trader Joe's Organic Pappardelle Pasta Nests come in. They're brought to us by one of the most highly-regarded pasta makers in Italy, who doesn't just put in the hard work of crafting each batch of Pappardelle Pasta Nests into the tender, delectable noodles that they are - they also mill their very own local, organic, durum semolina wheat to do so. They then divide them into easily- portioned, dry bundles to make at-home preparation a breeze: simply cook two to three Nests per person in boiling water for 12 to 13 minutes, then drain. From there, you're free to toss them in your favorite sauce-we tend to prefer something creamy and savory, like our Cacio E Pepe Sauce [sku70650]-and save the Nests you don't use for another dinner, another day.

   "description": "It's not every day that a new pasta shape comes along, so when one does, it's sure to make a splash. And what's better at making a splash than a waterfall? So named for the Italian word for \"little waterfall\", Cascatelli don't just resemble an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, they've become something of a phenomenon in their own right. An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a satisfyingly toothsome texture). Trader Joe's Organic Cascatelli, we're excited to tell you, passes all three tests with flying colors. Made for us by a trusted organic pasta supplier, who worked directly with the shape's inventor to bring it into our stores, our Organic Cascatelli exceeded our tasting panel's lofty expectations. Their slightly curved shape and narrow, lasagna-like side ruffles give them a real edge in holding onto pestos and meaty ragus. They cook to a firm, yet yielding, texture, with a delectable, tender chewiness. And, indeed, they're much easier to hold with a fork than their longer, thinner counterparts. Try Trader Joe's Organic Cascatelli with plenty of Turkey Bolognese [sku 94161] or Pesto Rosso [sku 68135] to see just how much these three aspects make a difference.

What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential -bronze coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture that help support the heftiness of its partnered sauce while maintaining a delicate chew. You may be familiar with Fusilli-the spirals that have filled our shelves and stomachs for years. But these Fusilli are distinctly different. In Italian, \"Corti\" means short and \"Bucati\" translates to \"with a hole\". Each bite-size noodle is corkscrew shaped, with a hollow center that makes for an immensely exciting eating experience. Pair it with a hearty bolognese sauce and be in awe of how much sauce clings to each noodle, while never feeling weighed down. Serve it hot or cold, in a vegetable soup, a pasta salad, or with your favorite TJ's pasta sauce. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati Pasta",

Pappardelle was on every menu, prepared in so many interesting ways. And then our traveling company returned home, and Pappardelle was elusive. So we challenged ourselves to find a Pappardelle option that was at least as good as what we'd enjoyed in Italy, one that we could offer our customers every day. We found what would become Trader Joe's Egg Pappardelle Pasta at an artisanal pasta purveyor in the Tuscany-like wine country of California's Sonoma County. Like its Tuscan inspiration, Trader Joe's Egg Pappardelle is made with durum semolina flour and real Eggs. It's crafted by hand in small batches and dried slowly, at low temperatures, in classic Italian fashion. It's even packaged by hand, by real people (gasp!), who take this whole process very seriously. Try Egg Pappardelle with hearty sauces like TJ's Bolognese [sku 80852], as a side dish for short ribs or pot roast, or dressed simply with TJ's Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 01465] and TJ's Grated Parmesan Reggiano [sku 91611] and hint of lemon.

   "description": "Quite pasta-bly the most famous noodle in the world, spaghetti is made a bit differently in the Italian region of Abruzzo, just east of Rome. Just like standard spaghetti, the Abruzzese version is long and thin, made with durum wheat semolina and water, but instead of having a rounded shape, this Spaghetti is uniquely square, and goes by the name Spaghetti alla Chitarra. A Chitarra is a pasta tool with a wooden frame and metal wires tied end-to-end, resembling a guitar (or chitarra in Italian.) Traditionally, a sheet of pasta dough is laid on the wires and pushed through with the use of a rolling pin to create its shape. Our Italian supplier mimics this method with the use of a bronze die extruder, which not only delivers the requisite square shape, but also creates a rough exterior texture on each noodle, resulting in superb sauce-sticking capabilities. Combine those attributes with a short list of exceptional ingredients (our supplier mills their own organic durum wheat semolina), and you have Trader Joe's Organic Spaghetti alla Chitarra. About nine minutes in boiling water produces pleasingly al dente pasta, ready to enjoy with your favorite sauce. We're partial to pairing this Spaghetti with a jar of Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce [sku 70839] or Cacio e Pepe Pasta Sauce [sku 70650], topped with a generous grating of Pecorino Romano [sku 18326].

Orecchiette translates to \"small ear\", which describes the shape of this pasta. This pasta goes well with chunkier sauces with cut up vegetables and larger chunks of meat or sausage. Rigatoni is a tube, similar to penne, but with a larger diameter. Both pastas are cut using a Bronze Die (as opposed to the cheaper Teflon die). The Bronze Die has a rough edge which scratches the pasta when it's cut (hence the whiter appearance). The result is, the pasta surface has more texture, which grips more sauce.

Trader Giotto's Tomato Basil Marinara is our personal ode to the flavor of sweet basil as it's so often enjoyed in its Italian context. Ironically, neither tomatoes, nor basil originate in Italy. Tomatoes made their way eastward to Europe as late as the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought newly discovered tomato plants back home from the Americas. Basil came westward, from India, via the ancient spice route. But, distant origins won't change the fact that tomatoes and basil taste like they are made for Marinara-like frescoes are made for the Sistine Chapel. Giotto's Tomato Basil Marinara incorporates the usual suspects: tomato puree, tomatoes, oil (extra virgin olive and soybean), salt, sugar, garlic, onions, and spices (parsley and oregano, in addition to the basil). We've cooked everything down to a smooth, slightly chunky sauce that has a bright tomato taste, accented by moderate basil notes. Heat it 'as is' and serve over spaghetti, penne, or any kind of pasta. (Thai rice noodles might make an interesting partner!) Use it as a simmer sauce for chicken breasts or meatballs. Or, let it be the starting point for your own sauce-creation. So many different ways to enjoy this sauce. Each 26-ounce jar of Trader Giotto's Basil Marinara is just $1.79.

But unlike many meals from our childhoods, a simple weeknight spaghetti and marinara dinner is still a staple that evokes heartiness, warmth, and family even into adulthood. And boy, can Trader Joe's Roasted Garlic Marinara get you there within minutes of cracking open a fresh jar. We start with a classic tomato puree base and crank up the flavors from there; soybean oil, salt, sugar, roasted garlic, and plenty of parsley, basil, and oregano to be precise. A traditional whirlwind of flavors, but an ideal balance of each one comes together to make our Roasted Garlic Marinara as delightfully delicious as if you were enjoying an authentic Italian dinner during a night out on the town. But we don't require a reservation, suit and tie, or parking validation for this authentically Italian Roasted Garlic Marina sauce to be enjoyed. And don't limit yourself to pasta recipes, think of this mouthwatering Marinara as just the beginning of shakshuka, minestrone, ratatouille, or a creamy tomato soup. All waiting, at your finger tips, once you pop the top of this shelf-stable sauce. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Roasted Garlic Marinara",

Or course, this approach applies to our product development, and you can witness the results in our new Bolognese Style Tomato & Beef Pasta Sauce. For many years, we sold Bolognese Style Tomato Meat Pasta Sauce [sku 80852]. It was good, but we thought it could possibly be more meaty and more flavorful. To accomplish this, we reached out to one of our suppliers who makes sauce for a famous NYC Italian restaurant. They knew just how to proceed, beginning with 100% imported Italian tomatoes that have a sweeter profile, ensuring a less acidic, better tasting sauce. To make it meatier, they brilliantly¿ added more beef! In fact, this new sauce contains 9% beef, compared to the 6% in our previous Bolognese (6% is the industry standard). It may not seem like a lot more, but once you taste it, you'll definitely see the difference!

Take cacio e pepe, for instance - translated literally as \"cheese and pepper\", this creamy, flavorful, two-ingredient-centered sauce is thought to have been invented by shepherds in ancient Rome, but still proudly populates restaurant menus to this day. We wanted to pay proper tribute to this sublimely simple, time-tested dish, so we went back to its ancestral roots to work with an Italian supplier who specializes in traditional recipes. Doing just as the Romans did, Trader Joe's Cacio E Pepe Pasta Sauce combines Pecorino Romano cheese, made from sheep's milk, with bold, black pepper to create a cheesy, savory sauce that's deceptively simple, and simply delicious. Now, a classic cacio e pepe dish that you'd find at a restaurant would usually be served over long, twirlable noodles like spaghetti or linguine. That's an excellent option for our Cacio E Pepe too, but by all means, don't feel boxed in: we find that this Cacio E Pepe serves excellently with all kinds of ravioli, or gnocchi, or in white lasagnas.

That's why we're excited to be making Organic Pasture-Raised Eggs available in some of our stores in the Southwest!

Even 'free-range' fowl don't get this kind of freedom! More specifically, Chino Valley Ranchers provide at least 108 sq. ft. of pasture per bird, which is far, far beyond what the USDA requires for 'free range' chickens. And this approach is not only beneficial for the birds, but it's also excellent for the eggs. These Organic Pasture- Raised Eggs are large and brown, with rich, golden yolks, and outstanding flavor.

   "description": "One of the greatest things about tofu, aside from its obvious health benefits, is its ability to absorb the flavors of the marinades and spices with which it's cooked. When you begin with naked tofu, marinate for a few hours, and then cook the tofu, it miraculously tastes just like the marinade. It's tofu's gift to chefs everywhere. Our gift to tofu-eaters everywhere is Trader Joe's Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu. A recent addition to the baked tofu lineup, this Tofu is packed (and we mean packed) with 30 grams of protein in every seven ounce package. Using non-GMO sprouted soybeans, our supplier creates bean-curd by coagulating soy milk to yield soft, white curds. These curds are then pressed into firm tofu squares, which are subsequently marinated in spicy Sriracha for 12 hours and finally baked to perfectly textured, flavor-filled tofu. The long marinating process allows the tofu to absorb the sauce's fiery spiciness and it's subtle sweetness, along with a hint of garlic for an added depth of flavor. It also creates a red and white marbling that is as striking, as it is fiery-delicious. Cut open the package and enjoy the Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu just as it is-it's cooked and ready to enjoy. Try it with our Organic Herb Salad Mix [sku 50066]. Or, slice and stir-fry it with our Asian Stir Fry mix [sku 81223], and then serve it with steamed Jasmine Rice [sku 52252] and perhaps a dash of¿ Sriracha [sku 50828]!

Well, if that's the case, dim the lights and cue the music-Trader Joe's Movie Theater Popcorn is ready for its close-up! No ticket? No problem. Our gluten free Movie Theater Popcorn brings the snack stand to you. Whereas most pre-packaged, buttered popcorn is air-popped and then sprayed with (often artificial) butter, we kettle-pop Trader Joe's Movie Theater Popcorn in piping-hot, real clarified butter, just like they do at the movies. The bold, buttery taste you love gets popped into every last kernel. Then, we take the Popcorn, spray it with a tiny bit of expeller-pressed vegetable oil (sunflower and/or safflower oil, to be exact), salt it (the oil allows the salt to stick), bag it, and send it off to our stores... where it sits and awaits its big break into your shopping basket. Enjoy Movie Theater Popcorn anytime you need some crunch to carry you through life's cliffhangers or some \"pop\" to punctuate the plot twists. Have a few bags on hand for impromptu movie nights, popcorn parties, and sports-spectating. If you're an \"extra butter\" person, try warming some TJ's Clarified Butter and drizzling it on top for a hot, fresh-from-the-popper experience.

It does seem, though, that right up there near the top of everyone's lists are Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels. These iconic nuggets ranked in the top ten when we asked our own Captains (that's \"Manager,\" to us) for their favorites. Judging from the number of bags that fly through our stores (figurative flying; the bags are not meant to be airborne), the love is near-universal. Made for us in Pennsylvania (properly prodigious pretzel pedigree), each real-peanut-butter-filled pretzel nugget is coated with coarse salt, and delivers crunchy and creamy and salty. They're great party nibbles with cocktails or beer, juice or even sparkling water, and they make satisfying snacks for lunchboxes or after-school. There's a whole pound of these delicious little gems in each bag, and we're selling each bag for $2.99.

While they're often associated with medieval German monks, modern evidence seems to point to either southern France or northern Italy, circa 600 CE as the true point of origin for the pretzel. Today, however, we'd like to give kudos to the nameless, faceless, timeless creators of that prized pretzel variation, the Stick. Easy to fit in a shirt pocket, captivatingly crunchy, and helpful in any Groucho Marx impersonation, pretzel sticks are perhaps the ultimate interpretation of this ages-old snack. And Trader Joe's Pretzel Sticks may be the ultimate interpretration of that ultimate interpretation. Golden brown, slightly salty, and tinged with just a hint of baked-in honey sweetness, Trader Joe's Pretzel Sticks are equally great on their own or dipped in your favorite mustard, cheese dip, or even salsa. That's just for starters: we find that they dazzle when dunked in everything from hummus to fondue, Chunky Artichoke & Jalapeño Dip [sku 54698] to Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce [sku 95214], your favorite nut butter to our very own Speculoos Cookie Butter [sku 96761] and everything in between.

The reality is, we have pondered this question, and we have been busy for quite a while making sure we got it right. With the introduction of Trader Joe's Almond Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets, we're quite certain we got it right. In other words, if nut butter and pretzels are your jam, you're going to find these little Nuggets irresistible. Like their PBP cousins, these feature about-an-inch long, crunchy pretzel nuggets whose exterior is generously crusted wtih rock salt. Inside, it's an almond butter abondanza. Really. More than 35% of the recipe here is almond butter, made from almonds grown in California's Central Valley. Every bite is crunchy (outside) and creamy (inside); salty (outside) and a little sweet (inside). Pair them with a cold lager or a glass of lemonade. Enjoy them on their own or as part of a trail mix. We recommend keeping a bag in your desk drawer for mid- afternoon snacking emergencies - we recommend opening the 12 ounce bag before you need it for quickest, easiest access.

   "description": "One might say that it's impossible to improve upon the sublime simplicity of a crisp, cracker-y breadstick. Well, to that, we say: that's not never stopped us from trying before! Made for us by a supplier in Italy, Trader Joe's Pretzel Breadsticks takes the basic form of a breadstick (the kind you might find as an appetizer at a cloth napkin Italian restaurant, rather than the softer kind you might get at a pizzeria) and properly pretzel-izes it. Each stick starts as a bit of rustic, sourdough-esque dough, which is rolled into a twisty, approximately eight- inch-long baton, then baked to a perfect golden brown before being studded with cruncht crystals of sea salt. Much like their combined, namesake inspirations, Trader Joe's Pretzel Breadsticks make a fantastic appetizer or anytime snack, all on their own. Where we think they really excel, however, is in their use as a dipping and dunking snack. We recommend trying them in everything from spicy mustards and tart, tangy aiolis (like our very own Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce [sku 27677]) to bubbly fondues and savory-seasoned dips of all kinds, like our Crunchy Chili Onion Hummus [sku 76277], Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Dip [sku 78032], or Pimento Cheese Dip [sku 71595].

Originating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile we draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they're generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal. To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice-we're partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese [sku 077726]. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D'Abruzzo [sku 048838]), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

That's because their profile fits what many of our Customers are looking for in a protein bar. For instance, the 1.98 oz. Chocolate Fudge Brownie ALOHA Bar is made from organic, plant-based ingredients, starting with an organic protein blend that includes organic brown rice protein and organic pumpkin seed protein. Organic cocoa powder, organic cocoa extract, and organic dark chocolate provide a rich, chocolatey taste. And the inclusion of organic sunflower and cashew butters help provide the appealing texture. Instead of being tough and chewy like so many other protein bars, this ALOHA Bar is tender to the tooth with a pleasant mouthfeel more akin to a candy bar. And though you may feel like you're eating a candy bar, your body will know it's getting so much more in this 1.98-ounce, 220 calorie Chocolate Fudge Brownie ALOHA Bar-including 14g protein and 20% of your daily recommended value for iron. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Go big, or go home,\" is a phrase used to describe that attitude of living life to the fullest. People apply it to sports, vacations, purchases... even food. GoMacro® is a family-owned protein bar company in Wisconsin that has \"gone big\" in our estimation. They're making yummy bars from sustainably sourced, organic ingredients; using recipes that are as clean and balanced as can be. This 'all-in' approach makes sense to us (and to many of our customers), so that's why we've added GoMacro's® Heartwarming Retreat Macrobar to our shelves. Like GoMacro's® other protein-rich Macrobars, Heartwarming Retreat packs a powerfully proteinaceous punch, with each 2.4 ounce bar containing 12 grams. And we're talking organically grown, plant-based protein, made from a blend of sprouted brown rice and peas. Inspired by fresh-baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies of yore and the heartwarming memories that those treats conjure up, Heartwarming Retreat bars are dotted with organic, fairly traded, vegan chocolate chips and organic rolled oats. Every bite is moist, crunchy, lightly sweet (courtesy of organic vanilla and organic maple syrup), and delightfully cookie-like. And on top of that, each bar is vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and soy-free - a remarkable feat for a protein bar/cookie crossover! When it comes to price, other retailers who sell GoMacro® bars may have chosen to stick to the \"Go big...\" philosophy, but not us. Price is where Trader Joe's draws the 'go big' line. We believe high quality, doesn't always require high prices. You might even say, \"Go low...\" is our price philosophy. That's why we're selling Heartwarming Retreat Macrobars for the lowest price we've seen: $2.29* for each 2.4 ounce bar. Go big and go buy some today! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

If it does exist-and it's an item that meets our standard of value-we just might begin carrying it in our stores. One great example of the latter? Quest® Protein Bars, which we began carrying in our stores in 2015 in response to some serious Customer demand. Five years later, and our Customers still seem to love them. It makes perfect sense-Quest® Bars not only hit the nutritional mark, but they also do it without sacrificing flavor. Each bar contains 21 grams of protein (from milk, whey, and plant sources) and 15g of fiber, yet only 4g net carbs and 1g sugar. They're some of the most popular 'low-carb' bars on the market. More importantly, though, they taste good; they're softer and chewier than your average protein bar, and the Cookies & Cream flavor even features real cookie crumbles and delicious, vanilla-y \"cream\" flavor throughout! We're now offering Quest® Cookies & Cream Protein Bars for just $1.99* each-a full 40 cents less than we did back in 2015.

Once you sink your teeth into a dense, soft, chewy ONE® Protein Bar, you'll see what all the fuss is about. Each bar is dipped in a sweet, white coating, and the bar itself chews like a denser, chewier cookie dough. It's sweet, filling, and indulgent, yet each bar contains just over 200 calories and only one gram of sugar - hence the name. You'll also get 20 grams of whey-based protein and, in the ONE® Maple Glazed Doughnut Flavored Protein Bar, you'll reap the benefits of 10 grams of fiber, as well. That's right: a protein and fiber-filled snack that just so happens to taste like a maple glazed doughnut. You're welcome. We're selling each 2.12-ounce ONE® Protein Bar for $1.99, so you can afford to stock up and have ONE® on hand whenever and wherever you need an energy boost - in the morning, at the office, in the car, after school, pre-workout, post-workout, etc., etc. You'll find them on the shelves with our other energy and protein bars. *This is us experimenting with slang; we mean killer as in \"good,\" not as in \"it'll kill you\"... how did we do? 11.27 .17",

   "description": "A single mother and former fashion model, Think!® founder Lizanne Falsetto knew there had to be a \"better bar\" for busy folks. One with plenty of protein. One without gluten (which Lizanne is allergic to), or genetically modified ingredients. One that would work on a keto diet. And, most importantly, one that didn't taste like some wretched amalgamation of sawdust and cardboard. The Think!® Keto Protein Bar is that bar, and we're pleased to offer the Creamy Peanut Butter Pie flavor in our stores. Soft and chewy, these Keto-friendly Protein Bars bars boast a remarkably light and fluffy whipped peanut butter interior and a rich, chocolate-dipped exterior. Each Bar is gluten free and contains 10g of protein, as well as only 4g of net carbs. They make a superb snack to satisfy a sweet tooth, and great source of protein for a pre-or- post-workout boost, or even an on-the-go breakfast, in a pinch. We recommend keeping a few on hand in your purse, desk drawer and/or gym back to stave off hunger - whenever and wherever it strikes.

   "description": "A barbell is a long metal bar used for lifting various weights are attached to its ends. A Barebell, on the other hand, is a short (relatively speaking) protein bar used to fuel said weight-lifting sessions¿ or simply for lifting to your mouth when you need something yummy to give you a boost! The Barebells brand of protein bars was launched in Sweden in 2016. Since then, the company has been doing the 'heavy lifting' when it comes to developing high-protein snack bars that really deliver on the flavor. None of their bars-which are now made in Croatia-include added sugar, and each bar packs an impressive 20g of protein. Plus, they are touted as some of the best-tasting bars you can buy. Barebells Chocolate Dough Protein Bar is the latest in the lineup-and we're jazzed to welcome it aboard. It boasts a soft, chewy, \"chocolate dough\" interior, a smooth, chocolatey coating, and crispy rice-like puffs embedded in said smooth, chocolatey coating. Prepare for (a) lift-off!

So when we find a protein bar made with quality ingredients, offered at a great value, we know we've really got something special. Enter: the Honey Cinnamon Peanut Butter A.M. RXBAR®, a superb addition to our already-stellar RXBAR® lineup. One bite of these bars and you'll understand why we just had to carry 'em. Made with mornings in mind, each Honey Cinnamon Peanut Butter RXBAR® proudly lists its four base ingredients-3 tbsp oats, 14 peanuts, 2 egg whites, & 2 tsp honey per bar-in big, bold letters on the front of the package, so you know what you'll be eating without having to investigate that tiny-print ingredient list with a magnifying glass. On their own, the combination of sweet honey, savory peanut butter, and rich cinnamon would be more than enough to make a simple, delicious breakfast treat, but add in the fact that you also get 10g of protein per bar from the egg whites? Now we're really talking! RXBAR® strives to create a product that's \"simple and delicious without compromising nutrition,\" and they live up to this promise.

With just a minimalist mix of peanuts, almonds, raisins, and candy-coated milk chocolate gems, every bite contains a remarkable medley of flavors and textures, which is why it's remained a solid gold hit with our customers for nearly 25 years. So how does one celebrate such a bar-setting snack? How about by recontextualizing it into a new setting: a highly snackable Bar? Proudly made with the same constituent components as the Trail Mix that inspired it, Trader Joe's Rainbow's End Trail Mix Bars are held together with a bit of tapioca syrup and a rich coating of dipped dark chocolate on the base. Like its predecessor, each Bar offers a nice mix of crunchiness from the roasted peanuts and almonds, a bit of tenderness from the plump raisins, and some fun, flavorful sweetness from the candy-coated milk chocolate, all of which is captivatingly complemented by the dark chocolate layer. We find it's ideal for enjoying before work or school, during a hike or long car ride, or after a run or gym day. Rainbow's End Trail Mix Bars",

The fertile soil, dry climate and moderate winters in the Southwest proved to be ideal conditions for growing pistachios. After years of trials, production spread from California to Arizona and New Mexico in the 1960s, and the first \"official\" commercial crop was harvested in 1976. Trader Joe's Raw Pistachio Nutmeats Halves & Pieces are grown for us in California, where US production first began. Thanks to strides in modern technology and food safety, these kosher (pareve) Nutmeats undergo a steam treatment, just long enough to make them safe-but not long enough to make them soggy. The result is raw nuts that are safe to eat and positively bursting with fresh flavor. Because these Raw Pistachio Nutmeats are unsalted and uncooked, their distinct, earthy, sweet taste is simply unmasked-they're surprisingly addicting! A one-quarter cup serving provides three grams of fiber and six grams of protein, making them a filling snack on their own. Their shelled state makes it a cinch to pour them atop salads or add them to a recipe. We're offering eight-ounce bags of Trader Joe's Raw Pistachio Nutmeats Halves & Pieces for $5.99, everyday.

Specifically, it's a word that's been used in the Guanajuato region of Mexico for over 100 years to refer to a rolled tortilla filled with meat and other ingredients. Those \"other ingredients\" can constitute any number of things, but we've stuck to using classic fillings in Trader Joe's Pollo Asado Burrito. The construction of our hefty, flavorful Pollo Asado Burrito is relatively simple. We take tender, pulled chicken (puttin' the pollo in pollo asado!), black beans, red rice with a bit of a kick, pepper jack cheese, and TJ's Corn & Chili Salsa [sku 79614], and we hand-roll all of it in a fresh, flour tortilla to ensure sturdy burrito craftsmanship.

Take, for instance, our oh-so-popular Black Bean and Jack Cheese Burrito [sku 38767]: the tortilla perfectly hugs the beans and cheese, keeping them safe until you're ready to enjoy. Now, when you use breakfast ingredients instead of beans and cheese, it's a real game-changer (or breakfast-changer). Our Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito aptly contains all the important breakfast ingredients necessary to deem this breakfast-worthy. We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, sautéed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious. Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment possibilities that lay before you. Do you like Ketchup [sku 55860] to accompany your breakfast? If you're from the southwest, you're probably reaching for the Salsa Autentica [sku 01535] the second you hear \"breakfast.\" Or maybe you like a spicier version, a lá Ghost Pepper Habanero Salsa [sku 59417]. Then there's Sriracha [sku 50828], Green Dragon [sku 54861], Avocado's Number Guacamole [sku 65355], Harissa [sku 55841]¿ As far as burritos go, Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito lives up to the \"tastiest, handiest food creation\" designation, and it's got a value to match.

Well, Trader Joe's Cheeseburger Burrito is here to change all that! To create this momentous meeting of two casual culinary collossi, our supplier takes all the constituent ingredients of a juicy, fully-loaded cheeseburger, including savory-seasoned ground beef, sharp, shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped tomato & onion, and classic condiments like ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish, then wraps them tightly in a flour tortilla. Every bite is full-flavored, satisfying, and marvelously multi- textured, setting a new standard for mealtime mash-ups. Equally delicious as a weekend snack, school lunch, or late night treat, this Cheeseburger Burrito can be prepped in the microwave for a soft-textured tortilla, or heated in a conventional oven or skillet for a crispier exterior. It pairs especially well with burger stand standards like french fries or tots, and just like a typical burritom it can be customized with hot sauces, salsas, or even more melted cheese. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Each one is made with a soft, whole wheat tortilla that's packed with fluffy egg whites, wilted spinach, and briny bits of feta cheese, along with a zesty, savory, sun-dried tomato spread. It's the kind of bold, breakfast mashup you'd find on the menu at a fancy brunch spot, with one key difference-it's available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, and for a fraction of a typical brunch spot's price. Not only is it a remarkable value, it's super convenient too: all it takes is a few minutes in the microwave, and you've got a phenomenally flavorful, herby and aromatic, on-the-go breakfast at the ready. Like any breakfast burrito worth its salt, it pairs wonderfully with all manner of hot sauces and salsas, like our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce [sku 74550].

Let the marinade sit for a couple hours in the refrigerator for a juicy, tender, and flavorsome experience. There are plenty of other ways to dress your food with Trader Joe's Cilantro Salad Dressing, that's probably one of the reasons why we keep restocking our shelves, other than the fact that it's absolutely scrumptious.

   "description": "Our Sauerkraut is in a pickle. Or is our pickle in some sauerkraut? Either may be true, but one thing's for sure, Trader Joe's Sauerkraut with Pickled Persian Cucumbers is the paragon of pickling tradition and innovation. The innovation? We've added pickles-Persian Cucumbers, to be exact. We've sliced them into thin rounds, lending extra texture to the kraut and providing just a little of that yummy pickle flavor. The tradition? This is Sauerkraut like your great-grandma used to make. That means all-natural fermentation. No vinegar added. No lab cultures to kick-start the process. No cooking or pasteurization. It's just raw cabbage and cucumbers with some sea salt and garlic. The salt draws water from the fruit and veggies (you did know cucumbers are fruit, right?) creating brine in which 'good' bacteria convert sugars into lactic acid-a natural preservative, which inhibits 'bad' bacteria growth. That lactic acid is also behind the tart and tangy flavor (more subtle than sauerkrauts that have vinegar added) and the extra crispy crunch of our cabbage-cucumber blend. Top your hot dogs. Build a better Reuben. Mix it with grated carrots and red onion for a healthy slaw. Consider it a ready-made side salad. It's like your great-grandma used to say, \"Whenever you're in a pickle, remain cool as a cucumber and reach for the fermented cabbage.\" What? She never said that? We thought everyone's great-grandma said that. At any rate, you'd do well to buy a jar of Sauerkraut with Pickled Persian Cucumbers for each of your friends-in her honor.

He was constantly tinkering with healthy recipes to feed his king-sized family. As the story goes, one day, he ground up a bunch of dried fruits and vegetables, mixed them with freshly ground, organic nut butter and honey, took one bite and declared, \"It's perfect!\" With that, Perfect Bars® were born. Perfect Bars® are sweet, moist, and satisfyingly dense, with an irresistable, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The Peanut Butter Perfect Bar® is made primarily of (you guessed it!) peanut butter, which thickens and binds with the addition of organic honey, organic nonfat dry milk, organic dried whole egg, organic rice protein, various organic oils, and a blend of organic whole food powders (think: spinach, kelp, apple, orange, etc.) Perfect Bars® are gluten free, kosher, and non-GMO. They're cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any added preservatives or emulsifiers-and because of this, these bars should be kept in the refrigerator so that their flavor and consistency remain intact. They can last up to one week at room temperature, though, so don't be afraid to toss one in your purse, backpack, or workout bag.

While we can't claim any specific benefits from drinking Trader Joe's Organic Bone Broth made from Free Range Chicken Bones, we can say conclusively that it is mighty tasty, loaded with protein, and ready-to-heat for a variety of applications. Our supplier begins with bones from Free Range Chickens raised on all-vegetarian feed, with no added hormones and no antibiotics, ever. Selected bones are roasted (for enhanced flavor) before being simmered in filtered water for 24 hours, along with organic onions, garlic & parsley; organic apple cider vinegar; and sea salt. The recipe yields a golden-brown Broth with a savory aroma, and rich chicken flavor. It's ideal for sipping, just like you'd sip some tea-except this cup (8 fl. oz.) provides 10g of protein! Use it as a base for sauces or soups, or substitute some of our Chicken Bone Broth for oil when you sauté veggies and meats.

From pizza crusts, to rice, to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. We recently found ourselves asking this question once again with the discovery of Trader Joe's Cauliflower Thins, an ingenious bread substitute made from sheets of shredded cauliflower baked together with egg, Parmesan cheese, and nutritional yeast. Take it from us: once you make a sandwich with cauliflower, you'll find yourself wondering if cauliflower's wonders ever cease, too. Perfectly sized for a number of uses - including as a vehicle for avocado toast, a tortilla or pita, or even as a kind of savory, cheesy pancake, if you're so inclined - these Cauliflower Thins provide all the structure and texture of flatbread with a fraction of the carbs (only three grams of carbs per serving of two Thins, to be precise!). And since each Thin is made with Parmesan and nutritional yeast baked right in, every bite is filled with a nice, savory cheesy flavor that complements deli meats, condiments, and sauces wonderfully.

They accessorize easily, too, be it with a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt, a dash of hot sauce, or our very own Crunchy Jalapeño Lime & Onion [sku 74473] and make an excellent breakfast sandwich when placed between two toasty English muffins.

Sure, there have been contenders for the crown over the years, but with all respect to the soups and salads of the world, nothing quite complements a sandwich as well as the briny, herby flavor and juicy, satisfying crunch that only pickles can provide. And Trader Joe's Kosher Dill Pickle Spears, available now in our refrigerators, are particularly proficient at providing both of those crucial elements. Much of that is owed to the fact that our supplier cold-packs them in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and even more resounding crunch at lunch. Speaking of which, we're especially fond of packing these Dill Pickle Spears along as a side for work and school lunches, where they'll help cut through richer flavors, refresh the palate, and allow you to enjoy your meal even more.

Perfect Bars® are sweet, moist, and satisfyingly dense, with an irresistable, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The Peanut Butter Perfect Bar® is made primarily of (you guessed it!) peanut butter, which thickens and binds with the addition of organic honey, organic nonfat dry milk, organic dried whole egg, organic rice protein, various organic oils, and a blend of organic whole food powders (think: spinach, kelp, apple, orange, etc.) Perfect Bars® are gluten free, kosher, and non-GMO. They're cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any added preservatives or emulsifiers-and because of this, these bars should be kept in the refrigerator so that their flavor and consistency remain intact. They can last up to one week at room temperature, though, so don't be afraid to toss one in your purse, backpack, or workout bag.

Since we couldn't definitively declare this mousse-like, garlicky masterpiece a spread or a dip, and we didn't want to pigeonhole it into one usage versus another, the solution was simple: we dubbed it Trader Joe's Garlic Spread-Dip! This kicky Garlic Spread-Dip has its origins in Middle Eastern cuisine, where it's called toum (say \"toom\"), the Arabic word for garlic. Fresh garlic cloves, canola oil, salt and lemon juice are slowly blended together to create an emulsion, which sounds simple in theory, but is actually a time-and-effort intensive process to ensure the oil and lemon juice are properly incorporated. And as anyone who's attempted to make mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce from scratch can attest, the finished product doesn't always turn out as intended. With Trader Joe's Garlic Spread-Dip, the hard work is done for you, so you can just open the container, scoop and eat. The versatility of this Spread-Dip cannot be overstated - simply use it anywhere you desire a creamy, bracing kick of garlic flavor. Serve it as a dip with French fries.

Salads take myriad forms - sometimes there's no lettuce at all - and dressings include flavors that wouldn't have been possible to imagine \"back in the day.\" A recent look at the dressing offerings in our refrigerated cases, though, didn't reflect this evolution. Sure, we had some in- teresting flavors, but we realized we'd had more or less the same salad dressings in our case for years and years and years. It was time for some updating. Luckily for us (and you!), it was right about this time that we made the acquaintance of a terrific new salad dressing supplier in Wisconsin. One of three in a lineup of new dressings is Trader Joe's Green Goddess Salad Dressing. A heavenly green hue, as its name suggests, this vibrant salad accompaniment is packed with Hass avocados, fresh herbs like basil, and chives, and seasonings that include green onions, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. Most refrigerated dressings are heat pasteurized for safety. That's great for safety; not so great for maintaining the fresh flavors of otherwise raw foods. Our supplier uses a process called HPP (that stands for High Pressure Processing), which uses very cold water and very high pressure to achieve the same food safety results, without cooking the ingredients. The result is a dressing with big, bold, bright flavors, and only 20 calories per serving! We're selling Green Goddess Salad Dressing in an 11 ounce bottle for $3.69, a terrific everyday price for this vegan, no added sugars dressing of distinction.

The base of whole and mashed beans is bolstered by apple cider vinegar with just the right amount of tomatillos, onion, garlic, and salt for balanced, savory flavor. The final kicker is a trio of chiles (jalapeños, serranos, and habaneros) that adds a touch of mild heat. Whether you scoop it with Organic Corn Chip Dippers [sku 92482], or put it in your street-style tacos, you'll find this Black Bean Dip is as convenient as canned, and as delicious as homemade! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

What we've learned is that some foods just aren't complemented by sesame & poppy seeds, sea salt, and dried onion & garlic. (Case in point, EBTB chocolate chip cookies were a failed experiment.) Nevertheless, we continue trying to enhance our favorite foods with this savory seasoning blend, and happily, our recent triumph is Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Greek Style Yogurt Dip.

For as long, however, those same qualities made it quite difficult to replicate faithfully without the use of animal-derived products. Until today, that is! Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing uses an ingenious mix of plant-based ingredients, including tofu, capers, mustard, and miso to create a deliciously savory, inticingly peppery, and satisfyingly creamy Caesar Dressing while remaining totally vegan. While Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing obviously makes a great vegan Caesar salad (simply toss with our pre-chopped Organic Romaine Salad [sku 32601] and you're ready to go!), that's hardly its only function. We find it also works fantastically as a dip, especially when paired with crudités, and even works wonders as a creamy, umami-rich sandwich spread. If that weren't enough, it's also a marvelous deal: we're selling 11-fl. oz. bottles of Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing for $3.99*, every day.

Part of that has to do with how it's made, typically by straining cool, refreshing yogurt of its whey until it loses about half of its volume, leaving a delightfully thick, tangy kefir cheese that's like sour cream, Greek yogurt, and cream cheese rolled all into one. Inspired by this Middle Eastern favorite, we created Trader Joe's Labneh to provide that extra degree of conspicuous coolness, no matter if you use it as a dip, sauce, or sublimely savory topping. It's hard to overstate just how versatile this Labneh is. Aside from its uses as an appetizer or dip, especially as part of a mezze spread, anything that you'd usually top with yogurt, sour cream, or mascarpone will be given a tantalizingly tangy edge by using this Labneh instead - even sweeter fare, like figs, grilled peaches, or apple slices. Of course, you can't go wrong with adding a dollop to a freshly grilled Shawarma Chicken Thigh [sku 60667]. We're selling eight ounce tubs of Trader Joe's Labneh for $2.29*. every day.

Boldly flavored with garlic, Parmesan, and chipotle pepper powder, and featuring toothsome kernels of sweet yellow corn, Trader Joe's Everything And The Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip truly lets you have it all.

Take tzatziki, for example: the decidedly dairy-based creaminess of this classic Mediterranean condiment is more or less its defining feature, and one that's hard to replicate without milk. After trying a few variations, we found that a plant-based, dairy-free cream cheese provided the best base, and after mixing in just the right amount of lemon juice and chopped up cucumber, fresh dill, and garlic, we knew we had it: Trader Joe's Vegan Tzatziki Dip was born. Creamy, herby, and refreshingly tangy, this Vegan Tzatziki is a rich and flavorful condiment that can be enjoyed as both a dip and a sauce. Perfect when paired up with other Mediterranean fare, its cool bits of cucumber and dill provide a complementary counterbalance to the aromatics of coriander and cumin, making it a great condiment for falafel wraps and bowls, in particular. A treat for vegans and carnivores alike, it's also great in a pita piled high with Gyro Slices [sku 55277] and greens.

Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and sensationally spicy appetizer Dip, and goes from there.

Available in our refrigerators for a limited time, this savory and superbly peppery Hatch Chile & Jalapeño Cheese Dip makes an easy hors d'oeuvres for a dinner party, and a great group snack when you've got folks over to watch the big game.

But look closely at our sausage section (we have such a thing), though, and you'll find an array of spicy choices that go beyond the usual suspects.

They're lower in fat and calories than traditional pork sausage-each link has a mere 100 calories with only six grams of fat! They're produced without the use of added nitrites, nitrates or MSG; and they're fully cooked, so all you need to do is heat 'em and eat 'em-on the grill or stovetop, under the broiler, or even in the microwave. Try one on a bun, the traditional way, or slice them into chunks and add them to enchiladas or even omelets.

It comes from the same part of the animal - the underside (belly) of a hog, after the loin and spareribs have been removed. Unlike bacon, though, the Pork Belly cut is considered fresh in that it is not smoked or cured. This variant makes a big culinary difference. Typically, raw Pork Belly requires hours and hours and hours of slow cooking. Who has the time, right? Not many, and that's why Bacon has been the talk of the belly, until¿ In recent years, Pork Belly has become ubiquitous on restaurant menus. Exuding rich texture and taste, it stars in everything from salads and soups to buns and tacos. Working our way through many a popular Pork Belly serving, we pondered the possibility of making the preparation more manageable to the everyday chef. We started by looking at just how the restaurants were able to plate it with such ease. As it turns out, for the many restaurants, they purchase Pork Belly that is pre-cooked. Well, hey - we can do that! We started by identifying a great supplier in the Midwest, the heart of the U.S. pork industry, with the capabilities to both cook and package the prime belly cut. They take the \"chunks\" of Pork Belly, lightly season it with salt and braise it low-and-slow for 12 hours. Each piece is then cryovaced, so the succulent meat stays fresh and ready to get cooking.

Our obstacle: cooking gyro (say: \"YEE-ro\") meat is no joke. Just consider the presumed roots of this dish, back to the time of Alexander the Great, when soldiers used their long swords to skewer meat, which they arduously rotated over open fires. Cooking methods may have modern- ized (a bit), but bottom line-it's an intense process. Luckily, we are in the business of banishing barriers to truly tender, savory meat. Enter: Trader Joe's Gyro Slices. Traveling to Chicago-a hotbed of gyro production-we sought out masters of this Mediterranean-style meat. The midwest meat mavins we found, expertly season their fusion of ground beef, breadcrumbs, and lamb, with garlic, oregano, and lemon. Then, they rotate and roast it until it yields. Lastly, they slice it thin, as though on a swords edge, so the meat remains supple, with edges that crisp when heated. Our Fully Cooked Gyro Slices come ready to heat and dish. While the flatbread wrap is a natural fit (traditional recipe is on the package), it's also delectable on a Mediterranean pizza or salad.

Has it ever struck you that using traditional methods to make those same meats stateside should produce the same results, but often doesn't? We know why. All other inputs being equal, it's the quality of the meat delivered to the salumi artisan that determines the quality of the finished product. Seems simple enough, right? Perhaps strangely, then, there are numerous producers of Italian-style meats that don't take this into proper consideration. For Trader Joe's Uncured Applewood Smoked Salami, we are working with a vendor who's well aware of the correlation between quality raw pork and quality salami. This Uncured Applewood Smoked Salami uses a combination of smoking and salt curing, thus combin- ing the best of traditional Italian techniques with those of Northern Europe. Formed with high quality cuts of pork raised in the U.S. without antibiotics, the sausage is seasoned and aged for a minimum of 12 weeks, a time-honored practice that allows the flavors to develop. The Salami is then cold smoked with applewood, imparting a distinctive taste we haven't found in other salami. It's produced without added nitrates or nitrites (except those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt), and available only at your neighbhorhood Trader Joe's.

Savory, flavorful, and perfectly textured, each pack feels like it's been carved fresh from the deli counter. Take Columbus Calabrese Salame, for example: it's soft-textured, finely marbled Salame made from coarsely ground pork, generously spiced with crushed red pepper in the traditional Calabrese style. In other words, precisely the kind of hot Salame you'd want to turn an ordinary sandwich into a dynamic deli experience. You can use Columbus Calabrese Salame to accentuate the flavors of your other sandwich ingredients, or go all the way with the spice and make s a sandwich with just this Salame (perhaps with some added Hot & Sweet Jalapeños [sku 56688] to really turn up the heat). You can use it to top a pizza for an even-spicier riff on pepperoni. Whatever you choose to do with it, you can find 5-ounce packs of Columbus Calabrese Salame in the deli section of your neighborhood Trader Joe's, every day. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

If you care about where your ham comes from and how exactly it's prepared, you'll be delighted to find Trader Joe's Organic Black Forest Ham-and organic is only the beginning¿ Our Black Forest Ham is crate free, which means it comes from pigs not restrained in small \"gestation\" crates while pregnant-nor are they moved to \"farrowing\" crates to give birth and nurse their young. Instead, these pigs are free to roam outdoors. And, they're fed an entirely vegetarian diet, which includes no animal by- products. They also receive no hormones (actually, federal regulations prohibit added hormones in pork), and they are given no antibiotics, ever. All this adds up to a pork product that can be certified Organic by the USDA. The Organic pork is seasoned with a gluten free brine of water, sea salt, organic honey & sugars, and organic vinegar-then \"tumbled\" to distribute the seasonings evenly throughout the meat. Though this brining is a \"curing\" of sorts, the resulting Ham is actually considered Uncured, since no nitrates or nitrites are used (except those found naturally occurring in cultured celery powder and sea salt). What really brings the flavors together is the final step: a slow, low-heat smoking over hickory coals to impart a delicious, wood-smoked aroma & taste. This step also eliminates that extra moisture you sometimes find in packaged deli meats. Sliced thin, our attribute-packed Ham is ready for anything-sandwiches, eggs, Chicken Cordon Bleu, pizza¿ We're selling the six-ounce package of Trader Joe's Organic Uncured Black Forest Ham for $4.99.

Recently, we came across the opportunity to switch from the conventional Columbus Rotisserie Seasoned Chicken Breast [sku 93901] we've been carrying in our deli section to a version with some notable improvements. The replacement is still called Columbus Rotisserie Seasoned Chicken Breast, and it maintains many of the qualities we loved about its predecessor. For instance, it's made with whole chicken breasts that have been browned in oil and slow-roasted to maintain the best flavor. It's also, still gluten free with no MSG & 0g trans fat per serving. What's new is the fact that this Chicken comes from chickens raised without any antibiotics, ever. It also has no added nitrites or nitrates-except those naturally occurring in sea salt and cultured celery powder. In order to offer this upgraded deli meat at a Trader Joe's value, we've slightly lowered the weight-and correspondingly, the price.

Over time, this tool becomes art itself, with its blending of colors and build up of impasto strokes. Like the artist's palette (and like our previous Salad Palette with Mango [sku 57190]), Trader Joe's Salad Palette Super Greens also begins with vibrant, separated colors-this time cooler shades: crunchy broccoli with a gradient of green; rustic, earth-toned walnuts; smooth light-green edamame and peas; dark-shaded, trimmed, green beans; all surrounding a bright white feta cheese in the center. You (The Artist) are invited to mix and mingle, turn and toss all these fresh ingredients, until they're an edible work of art, worthy of your personal palate (as in: 'sense of taste'). All these colors rest on a canvas of more \"greens\"-spinach, kale, and other greens... (exact mix may vary by region and season.) Of course, no work of art is complete without a signature; that's our Avocado Citrus Dressing. Like a well-lit painting on the gallery wall, Trader Joe's Salad Palette Super Greens is something to behold, as it beckons to be consumed.

   "description": "While most folks would probably peg the hamburger as the most representative American food, we'd have to throw our support behind the humble hot dog. Aside from its close association with baseball (the American national pastime) and summertime (arguably the most American season, though that's another topic altogether), only pizza comes close to the hot dog in its proliferation of regional variation throughout these United States. Practically every major American state and city has their own specific spin on hot dogs, from the vibrantly vegetal Chicago dog, to the chili-and-onion-smothered dogs of Coney Island, to the bacon-wrapped hot dogs of Los Angeles. And so, to help celebrate the holistically American hot dog, we proudly offer Trader Joe's Uncured Beef Hot Dogs, to be enjoyed in whatever preparation you prefer-from sea to shining sea. Our all-Beef, Uncured Hot Dogs contain no added nitrates or nitrates (except those that occur naturally in sea salt and cultured celery powder), and cook up wonderfully well on the grill, in the frying pan, or immersed in boiling water (or beer, we should add!). Once heated through, they have a fantastically snappy texture to their bite, and take well to all kinds of condiments and fixings. No matter which regional variation you subscribe to, or even if you just enjoy it with a simple drizzle of ketchup and/or mustard, our Hot Dog Buns [sku 98214], and Brioche Hot Dog Buns [sku 66433] will make an invaluable vehicle for them.

If you peruse the refrigerated case at most markets, you'll see plenty of fresh pasta, and it's all overpriced. There. We said it again. Moreover, most of it doesn't even taste very good. Ooh, watch out¿we're on a roll. And now, for the really important part¿Trader Joe's fresh pastas are not expensive, and they taste really good. A taste of Trader Giotto's Cheese Tortellini will confirm this claim. Each bite-size pasta piece is generously filled with a savory blend of ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses. To encounter this Tortellini is to encounter Tortellini with flavors robust enough to stand on its own, with no sauce at all, yet also shine with a touch of olive oil, cream, or red sauce (like our Three Cheese Pomodoro Sauce [sku 64484], possibly). This is also an excellent choice served cold as the star of a pasta salad. Serve it as a brunch or barbecue-your guests need never know you paid a mere pittance for the pasta at the salad's center.

Trader Joe's Porcini Mushroom & Truffle Triangoli are just like their square cousins in every way-except these little pasta pil- lows have three sides not four. It's something different. And we think they're acute. This isosceles pasta is produced in Italy, exclusively for us. Our supplier mixes unbleached wheat flour, eggs, and durum wheat semolina for smooth and resilient dough that holds up in boiling water, even when rolled very thin. It forms the perfect package to showcase our filling, which consists of both sautéed and dried porcini mushrooms, shaved black truffles, toasted breadcrumbs, and a touch of fresh ricotta cheese.

   "description": "During summer, the Italian countryside is blanketed in gold by fields of girasole (GEE-rah-so-LAY), known in English as sunflowers. The eponymous ravioli is cut to resemble the daisy-like flower heads. One might say, then, that Girasoli is the pasta of summer. We thought a summer pasta sounded sensational and wanted our Girasloli to capture the radiance and warmth of its namesake. We turned to our revered Italian pasta makers for a recipe. Committed to preserving regional culinary traditions, they presented us with a fine Ricotta & Lemon Zest Pasta in the style of Sicily, using real Sicilian lemons. It starts with classic, fresh, Italian pasta, made with only three ingredients: soft wheat flour, durum wheat semolina and egg. Tender and rich, the pasta glows golden, courtesy of the egg. Rolled thin and custom cut to resemble a sunflower, it is then filled with fresh ricotta, naturally creamy and slightly sweet, that is mixed with lemon zest and balanced with butter, bread crumbs and salt. The bite captures a sunny, summer day in Sicily. While all of the elements are essential, the lemons paint the picture. Grown in the volcanic soil around Mount Etna, the authentic Sicilian lemons have a bright acidity and distinct sweetness. Their zest gives a clean taste to the ricotta and bright character to the Girasoli. We think Trader Giotto's Girasoli Ricotta & Lemon Zest is best sauced lightly - with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and fresh chopped basil. Pair it with an arugula salad and a crisp glass of Mezzacorona Pinot Grigio [sku 00314] for a romantic meal. It is a radiant summer offering at $2.99 for 8.8 ounce package. 8.20.1 4",

These little mezzelune (meaning \"half moon\" in Italian) pastas are stuffed with some of those very ingredients. Carefully mixed and prepared by hand, the filling includes oven-roasted cauliflower grown in Mediterranean fields with a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Grada Padano cheeses. While the mezzelune shape is delightful and more unique stuffed pasta shapes, it wasn't chosen for looks; rather, the shape and thickness of the pasta has been especially chosen and perfected to compliment the flavor of the filling. Thanks to the flavorful yet versatile stuffing, a multitude of serving possibilities abound. Toss the stuffed pasta in some Genova Pesto [sku 15759] and presto! You've got the perfect pasta dish, ready for eating. It also goes well with gorgonzola and pancetta, and pairs well with a Pinot Grigio-try Villa Sonia Pinot Grigio Venezia DOC [sku 98153].

   "description": "We recently took a look at the fresh pasta section of our refrigerators, and couldn't help but notice that a pretty fundamental piece of the puzzle was missing: simple, traditional, classically cheesy ravioli. We immediately set to work with one of our Italian pasta suppliers to remedy this omission, and to say we were thrilled with what they came back with would be a tremendous understatement. Made with delicately thin pasta, wrapped around a luxuriously creamy filling comprised of four Italian cheeses, Trader Joe's 4 Cheese Ravioli have a mild, savory flavor, a satisfyingly tender texture, and, simply put, one of the best filling-to-pasta ratios we've ever encountered. Like our other fresh ravioli options, Trader Joe's 4 Cheese Ravioli make a practically effortless entrée: after just a few minutes in salted, boiling water, they're ready to be drained and dressed with whatever sauces or toppings you prefer. We find that their cheesy flavor profile lends itself well to pairing with our Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce [sku 50776], or even something as simple as a quick drizzle of olive oil, and bit of shaved Parmesan, and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. In the mood for something a little more involved? Try using them in an Italian Sausage [sku 66728] and ravioli soup. 4 Cheese Ravioli",

These pasta pockets are also quite popular with our customers, so we're introducing a new ravioli to the roster: Trader Joe's Italian Tomato & Burrata Ravioloni. But wait, Trader Joe's, weren't we talking about ravioli?! Why, yes, we were. And now we're talking about Ravioloni, ravioli's larger, equally craveable cousin. (To complete the picture, ravioli's smaller-in-stature cousin is called ravioletti.) As its name would imply, Trader Joe's Italian Tomato & Burrata Ravioloni is made for us in Italy and double- stuffed with creamy burrata cheese and a trio of tomatoes (crushed, roasted, and dried), plus mozzarella, butter, breadcrumbs, and a bit of basil paste. The pasta itself is delicate, toothsome, and two-toned-one side of each Ravioloni is red, and the other is green, thanks to tomato powder and spinach, respectively.

We call them \"pros\" because it's very challenging to fill and keep closed such small ravioli. After a year of research (no joke!)-and equipped with a new, specially made die to cut the pasta-our Raviolini line was up and running. Each Raviolini is 50% pasta and 50% filling, which is a rare ratio in the stuffed-pasta universe. The pasta is formed from a delicate, egg and durum-wheat flour dough. The filling includes spinach in a creamy, garlicky bechamel sauce, with a rich blend of ricotta & mozzarella cheeses. Given their tiny size, these Spinach & Ricotta Raviolini eat very similar to a plate of tortellini, where you get to enjoy a bunch of them in every bite. They're so delicious on their own, you may simply complement them with a drizzle of TJ's Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 01465] and a sprinkle of Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano [sku 83140]. And their slight stature means they're quick cooking and ideal for dropping into a pot of soup just a few minutes before it's finished simmering!

Indeed, Trader Joe's Spinach Tortellini take only two or three minutes of cooking in boiling water before they're al dente and ready to eat. Inside each artfully folded Tortellino, our supplier has stuffed a flavorful mix of spinach, ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan-so flavorful, in fact, that once they're done cooking, all they need is a quick drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of Parmesan before they're ready to serve.

Try using them as the basis for a hearty, picnic-ready, cold pasta salad with pleny of artichoke hearts and juicy olives.

But if you're pressed for prep time, or just want to get cooking off your to-do list, you can still conjure the coziness of the season and satisfy your squashy desires with the help of Trader Joe's Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Tart.

The edges of the dough are folded and pleated inward over the filling, leaving the center exposed to highlight the gem-like cubes of earthy Butternut Squash dotted throughout, and then the whole thng is baked to create a golden-brown crust. This rustic, freeform composition gives the Tart a homey, made-from-scratch vibe, but the only work required of you is overseeing a short stint in the oven to reheat and crisp up the crust.

   "description": "Meatloaf evokes the mid-century, American household. But if the culinary historians are correct, it's been around much longer than the 1950s. Apparently the fifth-century Romans had a version of meatloaf, and subsequently, just about every European people-group has developed their own unique loaf of cooked meat. We've incorporated the best of many traditions into our Traditional Meatloaf in a Classic Tomato Sauce recipe. USDA certified, 80/20 ground beef is blended with eggs, milk, and Panko breadcrumbs for binding. It's sea- soned with onions, garlic, organic ketchup, kosher salt, Worcestershire sauce, basil, black pepper, and Italian seasoning. The top is glazed with a classic, sweet-savory tomato sauce that is enhanced by Porcini mushrooms and Burgundy wine. Perhaps the real beauty of this Meatloaf is another tradition it brings to mind-eating together. There are so many realities of 21st-century life that have made the common meal, less than common, not the least of which is the lack of time to prepare the food around which everyone will gather. Thankfully, Trader Joe's Traditional Meatloaf is fully cooked. Steam some green beans or broccoli and microwave our Reduced Guilt Mac & Cheese [sku 95141] while the Meatloaf is heating up in the conventional oven. In less than 20 minutes, you'll have a \"traditional\" meal for everyone to enjoy. This 16-ounce (1-pound) entrée is $6.99, serving two to four people-depending on how hungry they are! 9.22.1 4",

It quickly became a favorite, inspiring us to create a \"fresh\" version, available to our West Coast Customers since about 2015. Now, we've gone national, opening up the refrigerated version to all our Customers across the country! Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala is based on that classic Indian-ish dish. (Was it created in India? Great Britain? No one seems to be quite sure.) Our recipe includes chunks of chicken that have been roasted in a tandoori oven and mixed with a creamy, tomato-based, mildly spicy, curry-flavored sauce. Yogurt, cream, milk, and ghee (clarified butter) all contribute to this Tikka Masala's creaminess. Garlic and ginger contribute loads of flavor in partnership with spices that include: coriander, fenugreek leaves, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and star anise. We've also provided essential cumin-infused basmati rice on the side. All of it heats up in less than five minutes in the microwave, or a few minutes more on the stovetop.

In other words, good wine comes from here! Wine Country Chicken Salad is our envisioning of a fresh side that might perfectly complement a glass of Napa Chardonnay, on blanket, laid out in sight of a hillside vineyard. This Chicken Salad is made just for us with very large pieces of white meat chicken, celery, dried cranberries, pecans, and poppy seeds. It's mixed together with a scrumptious dressing that includes mayo, honey, vinegar, salt and pepper. We think it's the cranberries that really set this salad apart; They add a sweet-tart flavor that's complemented by the crunch of the pecans and celery. It's so important that we convey this combination of fla- vors in the freshest way possible, we've found a supplier that takes the final Salad (sealed in its package) and sub- jects it to High Pressure Processing (HPP). This cold-pasteurization technique is an environmentally-friendly, and safe way, to preserve flavor and nutrients-and extend shelf life-without adding preservatives. There are so many ways to enjoy this fresh salad¿ Try it nestled on a bed of greens, stuffed into a pita, or in a \"chicken salad melt\" with sourdough bread and the melting cheese of your choice-our Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923] is a good, if unexpected, option.

This philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement, popularized in mid-20th century Japan, doesn't just apply to the way we work, it also applies to the food we sell. For example, when our Egg Salad took a brief hiatus from our refrigerators, we took the opportunity to see how we could make it even more delicious. Now returning to our refrigerators with a new look and a new recipe, Trader Joe's Egg Salad might just be one the tastiest examples of kaizen in action you'll ever encounter. Each batch is made with cage-free, hard cooked eggs, which are chopped and mixed with just the right amount of mayonnaise and tangy Dijon mustard to give it a light, yet creamy, consistency. We toss in some diced celery and green onions for good measure (and some added crunch), then add the finishing touches, like sea salt, parsley, white wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper. While Trader Joe's Egg Salad is certainly delightful on its own, it truly sings as part of an egg salad sandwich. We suggest using toasted slices of French Brioche [sku 56582] and adding soft, luscious leaves of Little Gem Lettuce [sku 76869]-or you can skip the bread and make egg salad lettuce wraps instead! And if you'd rather not commit to a whole meal, make yourself a snack by spooning this Salad onto some freshly toasted baguette slices and sprinkled with Smoked Paprika [sku 60290]. Egg Salad",

Sometimes you need to get a meal on the table (or in your lunch bag) right now. That's where Trader Joe's Cauliflower Tabbouleh comes in. Though tabbouleh is traditionally prepared with a base of cooked bulgur or couscous, our newest version is made with bits of riced cauliflower, which, in addition to providing tender crunch and nutty flavor, makes it gluten free! Tangy tomatoes and lemon juice add brightness, while aromatic parsley and mint bring zesty freshness.

The Mediterranean region, with its bright blue waters, white-washed buildings, and idyl- lic weather, is a place bursting with wonderful food, and one that frequently inspires our innovation. Ironically, the idea for Trader Joe's Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad did not come from such a voyage, but from a family recipe right under our noses... What started out as \"Carmen's Famous Orzo Salad,\" a side served at family gatherings and potlucks, eventually found its way to our tasting panel. The verdict was the same as every other time it had been tried: WOW. Our Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad, like Carmen's, starts with a pasta salad made up of orzo, crumbled feta cheese, diced red onion, Kalamata olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It's then tossed in a golden balsamic dress- ing and basil pesto and topped with shredded spinach-yes, a pasta salad that actually has some \"salad\"! The spinach-on-top layering ensures fresh leaves when it comes time to enjoy. Its savory and salty flavors perfectly evoke its regional namesake-it'll be almost as if you traveled there! Such a delicious Orzo Pasta Salad has so many moments to shine. Bring a few containers to that last-minute BBQ your neighbor is throwing, or enjoy it with grilled fish for a tasty lunch.

Of course, semolina elbow Macaroni anchors our chilled Salad in nostalgia, and the dressing mimics the creamy, mayo-based version of the past.

The inclusion of zest locks in the Lemon profile promised in the name, while the Herb component is distinctly dill-forward, partnering with parsley and a host of spices and aromatics.

It's a sauce that's taking the internet by storm - from food blogs to social media feeds, Zhoug is having its moment in the digital sun. This really is the ideal time to introduce Zhoug to our stores. Trader Joe's Zhoug Sauce comes to us from a California vendor well-versed in the art and science of Middle Eastern foods. Here, they've put together a very straightforward collection of ingredients - cilantro, canola oil, jalapeño peppers, chile flakes, garlic, cardamom, sea salt, and cumin seeds - to create a sauce/dip/spread/ condiment that bursts with vibrant flavor and color. We call it \"very spicy\" on our label, and some will find it \"very spicy.\" Those more into spicy foods may find it only moderately spicy. Everyone who tries it will be impressed by how the flavor of every ingredient comes through, even as the flavors blend beautifully into the finished product. Try Zhoug as a dip for vegetable crudités or pita (bread or chips). It makes a delicious sandwich spread, a super sauce for pasta (here's where it's like pesto), and a vibrant addition to a plate of meat or fish.

Though its precise origins are somewhat disputed, food historians generally agree that it rose to prominence as part of Argentinian ranch cuisine, likely sometime in the 19th century, primarily as a way to season grilled beef. Since then, as Trader Joe's Chimichurri Sauce deftly demonstrates, its uses have expanded to include sandwiches and seafood, burgers and kebabs, pastas and potatoes - pretty much anything that's savory and delicious will be even more so with a bit of Chimichurri on top. Starting with a mix of finely chopped parsely and cilantro, our supplier adds in minced garlic, dried cumin, and crushed red pepper, then blends in a mix of oil and vinegar. The resulting Sauce is a compellingly complex mix of herby aromatics, savory spice, silky texture, and even a delicately tart note that serves to wake up the flavors within any entrée it's added to.

The stock is made from scratch. The veggies are fresh. It's cooked in small batches. And each ingredient is added to the pot at exactly the right time. This is important, because when making soups, the success of the finished product is all about layering the flavors-and this takes time. Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup is teeming with organic veggies-like carrots, tomatoes, peas, and chopped kale-in a tomato-based broth, plus a bounty of kidney and cannellini beans, plenty of orzo, and copious amounts of herbs and spices. We've offered fresh Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup in winters past, but this year, we've kaizened it to new hygge heights. First of all, we've made it vegan. The only ingredient making our previous incarnation not vegan was beef broth, and as soon as we realized that we could swap the beef broth for veggie broth and get equally rich results, we were happy to do so. Because soup is for everyone. Second, we're using an even tastier, rice-and- quinoa-based orzo this year. It's got great bite, and it doesn't compromise the soup's gluten-free status.

Like last-minute plans with friends or making a meal out of the four remaining ingredients in the fridge. Other times, careful planning and execution is critical to success. Like when making soups. And Trader Joe's Lentil Soup with Ancient Grains is the epitome of such carefully-made soup. This isn't just any old soup. This is a next-best-thing-to-homemade-in-your-own-kitchen soup. The stock is made from scratch, the vegetables are sourced from local suppliers, the soup is cooked in small batches, and we add each ingredient at exactly the right time. This is important, because when making soups, the success of the finished product is all about layering the flavors. Therefore, our Lentil Soup with Ancient Grains has a lot of flavor, thanks to a satisfying blend of lentils, quinoa, amaranth, and millet in a savory broth made with tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, and a variety of spices. Because this soup is so expertly made, it makes an outstanding quick-and warm-meal. Serve it with shredded Parmesan Cheese [sku 85325] sprinkled on top and slices of Organic French Baguette [sku 53835]. Equal parts easy and tasty, you just might never make your own soup again. At just $3.29 for a 20 ounce container, Trader Joe's Lentil Soup with Ancient Grains will warm you on the inside when it's cold outside-and it's only around seasonally, so warm up while you can.",

Trader Joe's Washable Paper Grocery Bag is the \"so much more\" of brown paper bags.

Your first clue that it's out of the ordinary comes when you touch it. It's so soft! (And it softens even more as you wash it.) Then you'll notice the handles are longer - long enough to sling over your shoulder! When you actually use it, you'll really notice the difference.

The wild sunflower was first domesticated by Native Americans, who used sunflower seeds in a variety of applications, but true commercialization of the plant took place in Russia and surrounding territory. By the early part of the 19th century, Russia had some 2 million acres of farmland just covered in sunflowers. Doesn't that sound like a beautiful sight? And think of all those delicious seeds! Sounds pretty sunny for a country known for unforgiving winters... But we digress. Trader Joe's Roasted & Salted Sunflower Seeds are removed from the plant only when they're ready, then shelled and lightly roasted in a bit of-yup!-sunflower oil, then given a light salting to make their flavor truly pop. The slight salty edge makes them a great snack, and the fact that they're already shelled makes them remarkably convenient for ingredient purposes: just grab a handful from the re-sealable bag, and you're good to go.

A distant cousin of the similarly-not-a-nut cashew, Pistachios nonetheless have all the same satisfyingly savory flavor and craveable crunch of a nut, so we will continue to group them in with the other nuts (besides, we don't plan on creating a separate \"Seeds\" aisle in our stores anytime soon). And Trader Joe's Dry Roasted & Salted Pistachios exhibit everything that have made them such a pervasively popular snack. Grown for us in California's San Joaquin Valley, these particular Pistachios are dry roasted, which means they were cooked without the use of a medium like oil or water. This gives each Pistachio a delightfully chewy texture which interplays impeccably with their naturally mild, buttery flavor profile, which in turn is accentuated by the addition of salt. They're just as fun to crack open as they are delicious, making them a great snack for spectating sports, enjoying with drinks, or simply everyday snacking.

Trader Joe's Raw Pignolias (Pine Nuts) are from pinus sibirica (Siberian Pine) in Russia*, growing at altitudes between 3,000 and 7,000 feet above sea level. These trees can take 40-50 years to mature and produce pinecones, and the pine nuts grow within those cones. The Pine Nuts themselves take about two years to mature. This is not a crop for the impatient! Pignolias are famous for their important role in Italian pesto. They're also used in baking (Pignoli cookies!) and their distinctive flavor is a welcome addition to pasta, poultry, pizzas, and salads. In this Raw state, they're somewhat soft, with just a bit of bite. Lightly toasted, they'll deliver even richer flavor and good crunch. We're selling each eight ounce bag of Raw Pignolias (Pine Nuts) for $5.99 - that's $2 less than they were the last time we advertised them, way back in 2014. You'll find them in our nut & dried fruit section. (After opening, store the nuts in the fridge or freezer in an airtight container-they'll stay fresh longer that way.) *Note that our packaging notes Product of Korea, Russia and Vietnam. The 2017 crop is from Russia - subsequent crops may also come from Korea and/or Vietnam.",

   "description": "The story of the sunflower, or Healianthus Annuus, is almost as interesting as the story of the sun itself. (Okay, fine, that's a reach, but let's go with it.) The wild sunflower was first domesticated by Native Americans, who used sunflower seeds in a variety of applications, but true commercialization of the plant took place in Russia and surrounding territory. By the early part of the 19th century, Russia had some 2 million acres of farmland just covered in sunflowers. Doesn't that sound like a beautiful sight? And think of all those delicious seeds! Sounds pretty sunny for a country known for unforgiving winters... But we digress. Trader Joe's Roasted & Unsalted Sunflower Seeds are removed from the plant only when they're ready, then shelled and lightly roasted in a bit of-yup!-sunflower oil. While we also offer a salted version in our stores, we don't add salt to this one, which makes it a perfect option for sweeter applications, like getting added to your favorite TJ's granola or baked into bars. Salt or no salt, you can still take these babies out to the ballgame any time you like! We're selling each one- pound bag for $2.29,* every day. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

The heat from the piquant chilies glows when accented with the delicate, citrus-y essence emanating from the leaves of the Thai Lime tree. This lively flavor combination easily embraces the rich, meatiness of nuts. Our Thai Lime & Chili Cashews already beckon the bold and the beer drinkers. This got us thinking, what if we combined this winning flavor phenomenon with our most popular nut, namely almonds? Naturally, we had to try it. The vibrant, finger-licking, Thai Lime & Chili flavoring met the nutty, creamy, sweetness of almonds like they were great old friends, happily reunited. We think it really works! Made for us in Thailand, Trader Joe's Thai Lime & Chili Almonds are quintessential snacking nuts, great with beer and other bubbly drinks.

   "description": "What makes you smile? Much of the world smiles for pistachios. In China, pistachios are called \"happy nuts.\" In Iran, they're actually called \"smiling nuts.\" These grinning green seeds make us smile, too, and that's why we're offering Trader Joe's Salt & Pepper Pistachios. Approximately 98% of U.S. pistachios are grown in California, including ours, which come from the San Joaquin Valley. The saltiness comes from sea salt. The pepperiness comes from Malabar Black Pepper that is sourced from the Malabar hills of Southern India. This exotic peppercorn is noted for its robust flavor with fragrant notes of pine and citrus and a sharp heat. The so-called \"grin\" on each pistachio is a result of dehiscence, which the natural process by which the shell on a mature fruit splits partway open. With this split comes an audible \"pop\" that is said to bring good luck to whomever is around to hear it. Since our Salt and Pepper Pistachios are already harvested, it's simply too late for you to hear that pop.

If the kids were lucky, love might blossom, and that matrimonial match-though undertaken with mixed motives-could result in true romance. Being matchmakers in victuals (rather than nuptials), and with our undeniable soft spot for the romantic, Trader Joe's introduces Truffle Marcona Almonds-a fusion of two European, blue-blood comestibles that is likely to invoke feelings of love all across the map. Like most Marconas, ours are grown on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. This \"Queen of Almonds\" is wider and rounder than standard California almonds, with a sweeter, more delicate flavor. We batch-roast them in expeller-pressed sunflower oil to impart a soft, buttery flavor, and slight crunch. Along that same coastline- just further north and east-highly prized Italian Black Summer Truffles are unearthed. (A recent auction at Sotheby's saw one such titanic tuber fetching $50,000.) Our European supplier mixes dried black truffle flakes and truffle oil with salt that's been sun-dried on the Italian coast. This Black Truffle Sea Salt is sprinkled over our Marconas, balancing their rich almond flavor with a pleasantly pungent aroma and earthy taste. The gains here are not geopolitical, but culinary. How much should one pay to attend this royal wedding? Marcona-Truffle matrimony could fetch top-dollar- given the caliber of ingredients and the unique flavor pairing. But, Trader Joe's is no Sotheby's. We may vow to bring our customers products in which they can luxuriate-but never at a premium. These Almonds are no exception to our rule. By the power vested in us, this six-ounce bag of Truffle Marcona Almonds is value- priced at just $6.49. You may kiss¿ us. 12.17. 14",

Known to have grown in the wild as early as the 16th century, pecans were a trading commodity, and part of the diet of Native American tribes along the eastern seaboard of what is now the United States. Pecan trees were first cultivated by American colonists in the mid-18th century, and within a few years, they featured prominently in the gardens of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. An auspicious beginning, to be sure. Fast forward to the early 21st century (that's now), and you only need to go as far as your neighborhood Trader Joe's to find Unsalted Dry Toasted Pecan Pieces in abundance - shelled, cleaned, and ready to enjoy.

With the flavors of this traditional dish in mind, our intrepid foodie was awaiting a flight in a Thai airport when she noticed a nutty snack with a lime-chile-lemongrass flavor blend. Immediately hooked on the combination, she set about developing a version to offer at Trader Joe's. The tasting panel was equally enamored, and Thai Lime & Chili Cashews quickly became a TJ's staple. You could say, then, that this story goes from soup to nuts. Every batch of Trader Joe's Thai Lime & Chili Cashews begins with a particular variety of lime, singular to Thailand, that has an almost perfume-y flavor.

And people especially love cashews when they're fresh tasting-which is what these Cashews are when you open each little bag! They have been roasted in rice bran oil and left whole. We asked our supplier to salt them less-50% less than our regular Roasted & Salted Whole Cashews [sku 37883], to be precise. Thus, in each handful you get that classic, mildly nutty, buttery flavor with a hint-of-sweetness, along with just 60mg of sodium instead of 120mg. Every day you'll find the 15.6-ounce package containing 13 single-serving bags every day in our nut aisle. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Actually, let's start that line of thought over - did you know that there's such a thing as an official state nut? Delightfully, there are, and Oregon's happens to be the hazelnut, which only makes sense: Oregon's climate is actually quite suited to producing bright, slightly sweet, and exceptionally tasty hazelnuts - the very kind you'll find in a bag of Trader Joe's Dry Roasted & Unsalted Oregon Hazelnuts. While they're known primarily for their use in candies, desserts, and chocolatey spreads, hazelnuts are more versatile than they're usually given credit for. Their soft, yielding texture and naturally hearty flavor make them a great asset for savory dishes like pestos, salads, and stuffings, too. And since these Hazelnuts in particular are dry roasted but not salted, they're a great blank slate for use in whatever culinary scheme you may have going. You can halve them and sauté them with your favorite greens, crush them and use them to create a super flavorful crust for pork or fish. The sky's the limit!

Sure, we have some great options, but we realized that we've had more or less the same salad dressings on our shelves for years and years. It was time for some updating. And that's just what we've done. One of three in a lineup of new dressings is Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing. Inspired by Asia's best-selling bottled salad dressing, this dressing is thick, slightly sweet, and packed with plenty of umami- goodness. It's made with organic sunflower oil, organic soy sauce, organic white vinegar, and, of course, organic toasted sesame oil, which has been cold-pressed and cold-filtered to maintain its deep, roasted sesame profile. We also add whole black sesame seeds to deepen that sesame flavor, and a pinch of organic brown sugar to sweeten the deal. Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing is perfect in salads, slaws, sandwiches, and wraps. It pairs well with roasted veggies or cold pasta dishes, and it makes a marvelous marinade for meat of all types. Now that's versatility.

So¿ let us give thanks for bagged lettuce-specifically Trader Joe's Organic Romaine & Chicory Blend.

Their peppery, slightly spicy notes are pleasantly balanced by cool and crisp Romaine leaves. When combined, this Organic Blend of greens makes for a fast, fresh base for your favorite salad, and lends a thrilling counterpoint of texture when paired with rich, savory foods-think crisp bacon and a poached egg or sautéed Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667],.

Trader Joe's Sesame Miso Salad with Salmon is a prime example of this philosophy in action.

They also include a packet of crispy-fried onion pieces for a pop of texture, and a super flavorful sesame miso dressing to tie it all together. Once tossed, this Sesame Miso Salad wth Salmon offers a captivating complex mix of textures and flavors, from the light, leafy elegance of the spring mix, to the tender richness of the salmon, and especially in the combination of umami, spice, and sweetness in the dressing.

It's finished with a hearty portion of grilled salmon, which, when mixed all together with the included creamy Romano Caesar dressing, creates a marvelous mix of savory flavors and toothsome textures that all combine into one seriously satisfying salad. Ideal for on-the-go lunches and quick & easy, weeknight dinners, our Caesar Salad with Salmon is ready to eat right out of the fridge, and pairs particularly well with a fruity iced tea. We recommend packing it with some fresh fruit and a Sparkling Peach Black Tea [sku 68349] for a complete work lunch or picnic-ready meal. Caesar Salad with Salmon",

   "description": "When you have a crisp cadre of fresh-cut veggies, paired with a flavorful dressing, who can be against the slaw? In the case of Trader Joe's Crunchy Jicama Slaw, that truly a root-torical question! Our Slaw comes from Mexico, like the original Jicama root itself. Jicama \"noodles\" make up the base of this salad, with julienned carrots and diced radishes, cucumbers, and red bell peppers. The addition of shelled edamame brings a bit of protein to the party-3g per one-cup serving, to be precise. Inside the 11.5-ounce tub, the Slaw is topped with plenty of leafy, fragrant cilantro. Plus, there's a garnish-ready packet of chopped, dry-roasted peanuts for a finishing, nutty crunch. And no slaw-abiding denizen of TJ's salad-town would expect anything less than the spicy, sesame ginger dressing that comes in a separate packet, ready to add and toss with the veggies-whenever you're ready to eat. On that note, we're ready when you're ready; Trader Joe's Crunchy Jicama Slaw can be found every day in our refrigerators! Crunchy Jicama Slaw",

   "description": "The traditional Greek salad is relatively new by ancient historical standards. It was apparently invented in the 1960s when Athenian restauranteurs skirted a tariff on essential salad items by adding non-taxable feta cheese to an already popular plate of cucumber, olives, onion, bell peppers, and tomato. Tourists ate it up. Literally. Now, tourists of the culinary seas (aka our customers) have been eating up Trader Joe's Classic Greek Salad since 2005-which may not be ancient, but certainly makes this Salad 'classic' by our historical standards! And to this day, it remains a tried & true mix of fresh, Greek-inspired ingredients that harken back to the Athenian original. The base of romaine, with green & red cabbages, is complemented by wedges of cucumber, diced red bell pepper, julienned red onion, pitted kalamata olives, and-of course-feta cheese. A red wine vinaigrette- including dehydrated garlic, and dried herbs (oregano, basil & parsley)-comes in a separate packet, ready to toss with this Salad whenever you're ready to eat it up; which could be today, or whenever you decide to swing by your neighborhood store to pick up a freshly packed, nine-ounce Trader Joe's Classic Greek Salad.

Each of these has its merits, but we think there's something exceptional about Mexican salsa verde that warrants extra-special attention. For us, that \"extra-special attention\" comes in the form of our own Roasted Tomatillo Salsa. We make this traditional, south-of-the-border sauce using fresh tomatillos. We roast them to deepen their flavor, adding a hint of smoky goodness. We also roast jalapeños and Anaheim chiles before combining them with the roasted tomatillos and other ingredients-like onions, sea salt, fresh cilantro, dried cumin, and black pepper. The resulting blend of fruit (tomatillos are fruit!), vegetables, and spices has a savory \"green\" flavor, and a pleasant, medium amount of heat, making our Roasted Tomatillo Salsa the perfect accompaniment for a wide variety of savory dishes. Use it in traditional chilaquiles. Spice up eggs, any-style. Dip your chips in the stuff, or spoon it over a pile of nachos. Allow it to bring some citrus-y zing and spice to grilled fish, chicken, or carne asada. The list goes on!

Traditional salsa verde (green sauce) is a mild, tomato-less alternative to spicy red salsa in Mexican and Southwestern cuisines. Trader José's Salsa Verde, like any self-respecting example of this sauce, is made primarily from tomatillos, fruits that look like cherry-size green tomatoes, but aren't actually tomatoes at all. We use fresh tomatillos, along with fresh jalapeño peppers, to craft this sauce that's been talked about, blogged about, and most importantly, enjoyed in homes all around Trader Joe's country, for more than 30 years. Like most salsas, our Salsa Verde makes a respectable dip for tortilla chips. Don't let the \"salsa\" moniker stop you from trying it in a wide variety of ways, though. In an enchilada casserole, in a slow cooker with chunks of pork (a chili verde-esqe meal with virtually no work for you at all), with scrambled eggs (a flavorful way to make a Seussian meal), mixed in to add a little boost to your guacamole, as a dipping sauce for bite size chunks of Jalapeño Chicken Sausage¿ We've crafted Trader José's Salsa Verde with quality, vegan-friendly ingredients, without artificial flavors, gluten, or fat. Unlike so many jarred salsas on the market, this one doesn't contain thickening agents - its rich, texture is a result of slow cooking. We're selling each 12 ounce jar for $1.99, every day, the same price it's been for more than 10 years. You'll find it on our grocery shelves.",

   "description": "Legend has it that the Cowboy Caviar concept was originally developed around 1930 for an \"all Texas\" menu at a high-end department store. The head chef was mandated to include black-eyed-peas on the menu. Since she personally loathed the legumes, to make them palatable, she pickled them with onions, creating a salad-esque salsa -- \"Cowboy Caviar\" -- that has since become a cult classic. Strap on your spurs, Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar is now in your town. Since we love cult classics, especially of the crazy, creative culinary concoction class, and we've had good success with our other less- than-ordinary salsas, we decided to create our very own Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar. Instead of black- eyed peas, however, our \"caviar\" of choice is black beans that are mixed together with corn, onions and red bell peppers. Pickled in a blend of chipotle peppers, adobo sauce and lime juice, this crunchy, savory salsation carries southwestern character and enough heat to take note. It's a natural partner to tortilla chips and makes a delicious fish taco topping. Gluten-free, fat-free, low in sodium and vegan, Cowboy Caviar has \"cult-classic character\" written all over it, especially at just $2.49 for a 13 ounce jar. Yee-haw! (This is not the actual jar) CORRECTION: Cowboy Caviar Corn, Black Bean & Pepper Salsa does contain tomato as an ingredient. The information on this sheet has been amended to accurately reflect the correct salsa composition. Thank you.",

   "description": "We're always looking for something new-not just something \"new,\" but a product with interesting ingredients, fantastic flavor, and a unique heritage. Trader José's Hatch Valley Salsa meets each of these requirements and more. While visiting New Mexico in August, we happened upon the seasonal harvest of Hatch Chiles. The Hatch Chile Festival-in the town of Hatch, New Mexico-can draw up to 30,000 visitors annually. Visitors flock to experience the renowned flavor of peppers that share the town's name. But, these Chiles haven't just inherited the name; they've taken on the characteristics of the distinctive New Mexican terroir-the arid soil and dry climate that yield peppers with incomparable taste. No matter whether it was chance, providence, or just a fluke that we showed up, once we smelled for ourselves the aroma of chiles roasting over the fire, we hatched a plan. That plan has come to fruition in Trader José's Hatch Valley Salsa. The short ingredient list (Hatch Chiles, tomatillos, lime juice, and garlic salt) attests to the impression these peppers can make on one's palate. The handpicked, flame-roasted Chiles are hot-not melt-your-face-off hot, mind you-but definitely not mild. To these, we've added a small amount of tomatil- los and limejuice to round out the flavor, balance the acidity, and tame the heat-ever so slightly. The result is a \"sauce\" that is excellent with tortilla chips, or to dress up a taco salad. Try hatching an egg (and then scrambling and cooking it) to build a better breakfast burrito with black beans, a little crumbled bacon, and a healthy dose of this Salsa. Add some to your soups, stews, and crock-pot meals to bring the flavorful heat. In case you can't get yourself to the festival, we're bringing Hatch Chiles to you. Keep life spicy with your own 12-ounce jar of low calorie, low sodium, Hatch Valley Salsa for just $2.69. Muchas gracias, Trader José! 9.29.1 4",

   "description": "We're famously infatuated with pumpkin. You could call it our bread and butter. Honestly, you could go even farther and call it our Pumpkin Bread [sku 52484] and Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372]. But we hope that in all the pumpkin craze, we don't overshadow one of the best parts of the pumpkin, the seed. Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa. By combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the Salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar expertly. On top of that, each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of puréed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making this one seriously satisfying salsa. Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products. To cel- ebrate, we recommend using it in any situation that calls for salsa, from a classic chips and salsa appetizer (especially our Quinoa and Black Bean Infused Tortilla Chips [sku 97226]), to a topping for tacos (especially with vegetarian Jackfruit [sku 58772] tacos), or as the sauce for homemade chilaquiles.

One reason for this devotion is its USDA-certified organic status; up until now, TJ's Organic Tomatillo & Roasted Yellow Chili Salsa [sku 98838] has been our lone shelf-stable organic salsa offering. Another reason-the most important reason-is its sheer deliciousness. Made with big chunks of organic diced tomatoes, organic tomato paste, organic onions, and organic jalapeños, then spiced with organic cayenne pepper and organic dehydrated garlic, Trader Joe's Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa is fresh and flavorful, packing just the right amount of medium-level heat. And, boy, is this Salsa versatile. Sure, you can use it as you would any other-in burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, with tortilla chips, etc. But you can also use it in less expected ways. Spoon it atop baked chicken or fish. Pour a few jars into a slow cooker with TJ's Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs [sku 61046] and vegetables. Use it as the sauce on a tasty Mexican-inspired pizza. Or, just scoop it up with TJ's Organic Taza Blues [sku 63102]. We're selling each 16-ounce jar of Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa for $2.49-a fantastic everyday value for a fantastic, everyday salsa.

It's an a-maizing condiment, beginning with a base of sweet corn, and blended with finely diced red bell peppers, onions, jalapeño peppers, and a bit of sugar. By \"a base of sweet corn,\" we mean, \"lots and lots of sweet corn.\" As in, 1.8 ears of corn in every jar - we have taken them off their cobs to make them fit. (We've sold enough of this salsa that over time, this has added up to more than 41,313,173 ears of corn.) It has a little kick, but it's not what we'd call hot. Pile it into tacos or burritos, scoop it up with Organic Corn Dippers [sku 92482], spoon it over salads or chili or soup, use it as a dip for veggies, fold it into scrambled eggs, serve it as a side dish with grilled chicken or fish, blend it into Queso Dip [99262], or even use it in place of traditional relish on a hot dog.

Strawberry shortcake is undoubtedly delicious any time of year, but indulging in a creamy, cakey, sweet and slightly tart one on a long, lazy, summer afternoon, it feels downright decadent. Taking inspiration from this seasonal luxury, we set out to create a perfectly portioned (and highly portable!) version in the form of Trader Joe's Strawberry Shortcake Sandwich Cookies. Each Sandwich Cookie is made by pressing together two rich, crumbly, strawberry-bit-studded butter cookies between a dollop of sweet, fluffy buttercream filling. The resulting bite is a remarkable medley of textures, ranging from the flaky, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the cookie to the wondrous creaminess of the filling inside, all anchored by the deliciously ripe and fruity flavor of the strawberry bits throughout.

We have an assortment of vibrant colors (each bunch is of a single color), all on long, straight stems with multiple blooms per stem - they look simply stunning in a clear glass vase. Because our supplier sees a spike in production at this time of year, we have the opportunity to offer an even greater value than our everyday offering, and that opportunity just happens to happen in time for inclusion in the Fearless Flyer - we love it when things come together like this. For a limited time, we are able to offer this 20 Stem Bunch for the astonishing price of $4.99, only a dollar more than our everyday, 9-stem bunch. But get 'em while they last - ethereal beauty like this, at this kind of earthbound price, doesn't stick around forever¿",

This particular blend of ingredients is beneficial for all skin types, so if you have eczema or dry skin, or you just like to keep your skin feeling soft and fresh, our Coconut Body Butter is nourishing, gentle, and soothing. We've seen similar products, made with similar ingredients, for as much as $20 in specialty stores. At Trader Joe's, we're selling Coconut Body Butter in an eight ounce jar for the very excellent price of $5.49. Now that's a value!",

And for good reason - unlike creams, moisturizers, and lotions, which are comprised of occlusive (airtight) ingredients and permeate only the first layer of skin, Serums are made of much smaller molecules and actually penetrate the first three layers of skin. With this in mind, we've loaded dermatologist-formulated Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum with an abundance of antioxidants (including resveratrol & Vitamin C); Coenzyme Q10; Vitamins A, D3, E, & B5; and plant extracts like coffee seed & green tea. You can use this clear, silky Serum by itself or as a make-up primer-but we highly recommend layering it under your favorite TJ's moisturizer & TJ's sunscreen. If you're already a devotee of our equally high-end TJ's Nourish Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum [sku 61136], simply use the Hyaluronic Serum as a base layer, then apply Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum on top of it. Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum is suitable for all skin types, and it'll leave your face feeling velvety-smooth. Serums like this typically come with ridiculous price tags (we're talking up to $50 per ounce!), but we're selling each one-fluid-ounce bottle of Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum for $9.99.

Liquid soap didn't even exist until 1865, when William Sheppard was issued the first patent for this liquid form. We're all glad of this creation, especially because it led to Trader Joe's Pink Pomelo Grapefruit Hand Soap. Made with coconut-derived surfactants (the material responsible for soap's lathering, bubbling, and cleansing), our Pink Pomelo Grapefruit Hand Soap is made without synthetic dyes, phthalates, or parabens. Aside from doing its job wonderfully, this Soap smells fantastic. Its scent brings joy to all who use it-and we're thinking soap doesn't usually tend to elicit such strong emotion. It smells of pink pomelo and grapefruit. Pomelo is grapefruit's larger, sweeter cousin, and it lends this soap a slightly floral scent that complements the grapefruit's tartness. Jojoba and argan oils ensure this sudsy Soap leaves your hands smooth and moisturized. You'll find 17-fluid-ounce bottles of Pink Pomelo Grapefruit Hand Soap for $3.99 each, every day.

We're totally making that up. But we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment; hair is, or certainly can be, an integral part of one's identity-one's ornamental crown, if you will. We're not fans of the concept of \"good\" and \"bad' hair days (because who is the arbiter of such things anyhow?), but we do know that certain environmental factors and elective processes (like dying, perming, straightening, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you'll likely need something a little more intense than regular-old conditioner to bring it back to life - something like Trader Joe's Hair Mask. Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, and a variety of fruit extracts (like blackberry, mulberry, currant, and açai), Trader Joe's Hair Mask is thick, rich, and sure to revive even the dullest of mane. It's also free of parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, and phthalates, and it's never tested on animals. You can use our Hair Mask as frequently or as infrequently as you like - your hair; your call. After shampooing, simply massage it into your hair from roots to ends (concentrating on the ends rather than the roots if your hair is fine or oily), leave it in for 3 to 5 minutes, then rinse. The coconut-vanilla scent and touchably-soft silkiness will linger, but a heavy, greasy residue will not. Trust us, you're going to love this stuff. Trader Joe's Hair Mask is a salon-quality hair treatment, but we're selling it at an average Joe price - $3.99 per 5.1-fluid-ounce tube. After all, you shouldn't have to be sitting upon a pile of riches to afford the maintenance on your \"richest ornament.\" (Thanks for that one, Luther...)

Equal parts hydrating and refreshing, Trader Joe's Rose Water Facial Toner is formulated with real Damask rose water and Damask rose oil (to bedew and moisturize), witch hazel (to balance and tone), and a bit of Quillaja saponaria (soapbark) extract (to soften and condition). Best of all, it smells exactly like a fresh, blooming rose- so you'll actually smell the roses while you're taking a moment to stop, relax, and¿ smell the roses. Mist Rose Water Facial Toner onto your beautiful face after cleansing (give TJ's Facial Cleansing Oil [sku 58807] a try) or as needed throughout the day for a quick refresher. Pack a bottle in your purse, gym bag, or carry-on for on-the-go toning and/or in-the-air hydrating. The formula is so mild and gentle that there is really no such thing as \"too much Toner\"-so feel free to spritz this soothingly-scented spray anytime you need a moment of calm.

Okay, we're totally making that up, but we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment. Hair is is often an integral part of one's identity-one's ornamental crown, if you will.

And when this is the case, you'll likely need a little something extra to help tame frizz and add shine...something like Trader Joe's Hair Serum. Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, keratin and a variety of plant-based extracts (like black currant, açai, & macadamia seed), Trader Joe's Hair Serum is notably silky & moisturizing, yet still lightweight. In other words, it helps add shine and lustre to even the dullest of mane, without weighing it down.

Trader Joe's Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion. Our vegan, PABA-free, hypoallergenic Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen Lotion is formulated with the mineral zinc oxide, a non-chemical sun protectant that acts as a physical barrier between your skin and the sun.

This allows the Mask to contour & adhere to your face more securely, bringing even more of the serum in contact with your skin. This, you'll find, is a very good thing, because this skin-soothing, ultra-moisturizing, seasonally-spiced serum contains a bevvy of beneficial ingredients-like pumpkin seed & turmeric root extracts, aloe leaf juice, shea butter esters, colloidal gold, hydrolyzed silk protein, & more.

Now your hair is a mess, but you don't have time to take a shower. Wouldn't it be great to be able to give your hair a quick wash, without actually having to work up a literal or figurative lather? With Trader Joe's Dry Shampoo, now you can. Fast, easy, and conveniently sized for travel, this Dry Shampoo is a simple, effectve way to revitalize your hair - no shower required. How does it work? Simply apply a few pumps of the Dry Shampoo onto the roots of your hair, and let it sit for a few seconds to absorb any excess oils. Then, massage or brush it out, give your hair a quick towelling off, and you're ready to face the day. In addition to its on-the-go uses, it also makes a great hair refresher in between more in-depth shampooings. Other brands out there can run into the $10 and $20 range, but we're selling Trader Joe's Dry Shampoo for the refreshingly reasonable everyday retail of $4.99* for each 1.75-ounce bottle.

Instead of a liquid, packaged in a plastic bottle, our Peppermint & Tea Tree Shampoo is an oval shaped, solid Bar. The base of this Shampoo Bar is saponified oils (oils that have been converted into soap by reaction with alkali) that include coconut oil, olive oil, and castor oil. Added to this base are jojoba, peppermint, tea tree, and eucalyptus oils. There are also some dried mint leaves that give the white bar an attractive, green-flecked appearance. What this Bar doesn't have is parabens or sulfates! This combination not only thoroughly cleans hair, it also creates a truly satisfying shampooing experience. Of course, this satisfaction comes, in part, from the rejuvenating qualities of Peppermint & Tea Tree oils. But it also comes from the knowledge that we've packaged this Shampoo with an FSC-certified mix of cardboard from responsible sources.

Luckily, PABA, paraben, and oxybenzone-free Trader Joe's Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen - SPF 30 is here to save the day & spare your skin. With Zinc Oxide as its active ingredient, this new addition to our line-up of might sun-blockers is what's known as a \"mineral\" or \"physical\" sunscreen, rather than a \"chemical\" sunscreen. In other words, the zinc acts as a physical barrier between the sun's potentially harmful UVA & UVB rays and your ever-important epidermis! But don't worry, unlike some zinc-based sunscreens, our Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen won't leave behind that ghostly white cast-it rubs in clear, it's SPF 30, and it's water resistant for up to 90 minutes. It's also fragrance-free, and formulated with moisturizing, hydrating aloe vera, grapefruit oil, and Vitamin E! Pretty good deal, right? Actually, to answer our own question above, it's not just a pretty good deal; it's a very good deal. Literally.

Scientifically, this name refers to the marula, which is a deciduous tree of medium stature, growing mainly in southern Africa. The marula tree bears a fleshy fruit with seeds (hard nuts) inside. Locally, people like to mix the fleshy fruit with water and allow it to ferment to create a traditional alcoholic beverage; but globally, the marula is known for the cosmetic oil derived from its seeds. Trader Joe's Marula Facial Oil is produced from the first (virgin) cold-pressing of marula seeds, harvested only when the fruit has fallen to the ground. The oil is light-textured and not greasy. It's especially good for hydrating skin. Marula Oil also offers antioxidants to promote a soft radiance-that glowing visage you've been hoping for! It is excellent for daily use, and at $6.99* for the 0.85 fluid-ounce bottle, that's a valuable proposition; especially considering the fact that you can find similarly sized bottles elsewhere from $9 all the way up to $50 and more! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

And when we say \"dream come true,\" we mean that (almost) literally, because this complexion companion goes to work while you slumber! Ladies and gentlefolks, from the skincare-centric minds that brought you Trader Joe's Antioxidant Facial Serum [sku 51150] and Trader Joe's Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum [sku 61136], we present Trader Joe's Retinol Night Serum with Baobab Seed Oil. In simplest terms, our dermatologist-formulated Retinol Night Serum acts as an exfoliant, sloughing off dead skin cells as you sleep, to reveal a revitalized you come morning. Included in a carefully selected 0.3% concentration, Retinol (vitamin A) is clearly the Serum's star player, but if you take a peek at its ingredients, you'll find an impressive supporting cast, too - skincare superheroes like sodium hyaluronate, vitamins C & E, salicylic acid, and, of course, skin-soothing Baobab Seed Oil. Whether you're a retinol rookie or a seasoned pro, we think you'll be over the moon for this midnight miracle. For best results, we suggest incorporating this new step into your skincare routine slowly - start by applying it once or twice a week, as your skin tolerates it, followed by a generous layer of your favorite TJ's moisturizer. And remember: chemical exfoliants like retinol can increase photosensitivity, so be sure to apply a broad spectrum sunscreen daily. Sweet dreams! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Easy to tote and easy to use, Trader Joe's Unscented Deodorant makes an excellent everyday deodorant: simply apply liberally under the arms prior to work, school, a workout, a hike, or travel of all kinds. Like all of Trader Joe's health and beauty products, you can rest assured that it was never tested on animals.

Luckily for you, Trader Joe's has high quality sunscreen at the ready, at incredibly affordable prices. Namely, Trader Joe's Nourish Spray Sunscreen SPF 50.

Most of the time, you'll hear them declare a dream of one day becoming a plate of lox. And why not? That lightly brined salmon fillet is enjoyed in delis throughout the world. But, the prepubescent salmon community is not without its rebels. Keep fishing and you're bound to find one or two who have grand ambitions for a more robust afterlife¿ say, as a plate of pastrami. We get it. We, ourselves, are not without a certain rebellious streak. Doing our part to fulfill the dreams of defiant salmon everywhere (actually it's really just the ones in Chile) Trader Joe's introduces Pastrami Style Atlantic Smoked Salmon. This is delicate and buttery, melt-in-your-mouth salmon, combined with bold pastrami seasonings, and a balance of unique smoke flavors. Each premium Atlantic salmon fillet-farm-raised in southern Chile-is first brined in a recipe of salt, sugar, herbs and spices. It's then cold smoked in small batches using a combination of Maine hardwoods (maple and oak) and fruitwoods (cherry and apple). The fillets are then rubbed with Pastrami spices-those familiar flavors of coriander, black pepper, allspice, and paprika. This recipe is accomplished in a Level-3 Safe Quality Food (SQF) facility, which demands the most stringent standards for food quality and safety. With our Pastrami Style Smoked Atlantic Salmon, customers get to experience a tasty and unique salmon flavor profile that works just as well on bagels with cream cheese, as it does mixed into your scrambled eggs. At the same time, juvenile deliquent salmon get to realize a childhood dream. Win-win! Each four-ounce package is priced less than your average pastrami sandwich, at just $4.99. 4.09.1 5",

It's flaky, flavorful, and boasts the perfect balance of smokiness to complement the salmon's natural richness and its proprietary, gluten-free brine. Trader Joe's Hot Smoked Salmon Fillet goes beyond the bagel-add it to eggs, salads, sandwiches, or pasta dishes. Since it's rather attractive and ready-to-eat, you can also make it your center-of-the-plate entrée, perhaps alongside some quinoa and greens. We're selling each 6-ounce Hot Smoked Salmon Fillet for $8.99, which comes out to about $1.50 per ounce. Other retailers sell these Fillets for $2.25 per ounce (and up!), so no matter how you choose to enjoy this Smoked Fillet, you can be sure you're getting a smokin' deal. You'll find it in the deli cases at our Northeastern stores. 10.16. 17",

   "description": "Sockeye salmon do not have distinctive eyes. They do, however, have distinctive, red-orange colored flesh. In fact, \"sockeye\" is an Anglicized version of suk-kegh (\"red fish\") from the language of one of the indigenous peoples of British Columbia. Indeed, our Sockeye Salmon presents this peppy hue. It's wild-caught in the icy waters of the major Northeast Pacific fishing area located west of Canada and south of Alaska. Our supplier dry cures the Wild Sockeye then smokes it very slowly over applewood (from Washington state apple trees) at a relatively low temperature (below 85°F) to yield firm-textured fish with rich salmon flavor, and hints of smoke & salt. The finished fish is already trimmed and boned, ready to top a bagel. Add it to eggs or pasta. Or, mix some with Whipped Cream Cheese [sku 12498] for a swift and superb salmon spread. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Wild Sockeye Smoked Salmon",

Don't get us wrong, we love smoked salmon of all kinds, but every now and then, specially-seasoned sensations like our Pastrami Style Smoked Atlantic Salmon [sku 53848] or our gravlax-inspired holiday sets just give us something extra. That's why, when we decided to bring in another smoked salmon, we knew we didn't want to season it with just anything. Instead, we chose to use everything - but the bagel, that is. Say hello to a little something we call Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon! Made using the same mix of spices as our best-selling Everything But The Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 59137], Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon takes the classic combination of smoked salmon and a fully-loaded \"everything\" bagel, and rolls it into one delicious, brunch-ready treat - minus the actual bagel, of course. Each slice of delicately smoked Atlantic salmon is given a generous dusting of crunchy dried garlic and onion, flavorful poppy seeds, and a mix of delightfully nutty black and white sesame seeds. This combo of savory & smoky, soft & crunchy makes it an elevated alternative for any typical smoked salmon application, be it in hors d'oeuvres, eggs benedict, salads, or your standard brunch spread. Why, you can even top a freshly toasted, cream cheese-covered \"everything\" bagel with a slice or two - because who doesn't want a little more of everything? We're selling each 4-ounce package of Everything But The Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon for $5.49 - in the world of smoked salmon, that's nothing short of a spectacular value.

   "description": "You can tell a lot about a piece of smoked salmon by the wood that was used to smoke it. Cherrywood smoked salmon, for instance, tends to have a delicately fruity flavor. Alder smoked salmon, a traditional favorite in the Pacific Northwest, is often mild and well-balanced. Oak smoked salmon, like the kind that can be found in Trader Joe's Oak Smoked Salmon Pieces, is marked by hearty, toasty, even nutty notes - a classic profile that pairs perfectly with a toasted bagel. Made for us by a suppler in the U.K., these Oak Smoked Salmon Pieces are a dependably delicious addition to all kinds of breakfast and brunch fare, bet it a time-honored lox, eggs, and onion scramble, elegantly constructed salmon Benedict, or savory salmon quiche. But that's hardly all: they're also ideal for using in appetizers, salads, and cold noodle dishes, where their deep, oaky smoke notes will add a delightful new dimension of flavor. And since it's from Trader Joe's, you can tell that it's going to be a tremendous value - our retail is about half what you'd pay for imported British smoked salmon at other stores! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Over the last couple years, we've introduced a number of Cold Pressed Juices, including Green [sku 52902], Red [sku 52903], Yellow [sku 52904], and Watermelon [sku 55374]. This year, we're adding a unique and delicious flavor to the line-up-one we haven't seen anywhere else. Meet Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Cantaloupe Juice. Each 15.2-ounce, 140-calorie bottle contains only cantaloupe juice and lime juice. (That's one-and-a-half pounds of cantaloupe and one-third of a lime to be precise.) We \"juice\" it in a slow hydraulic press for maximum liquid extraction. Once bottled, our juice goes through a cold, water-pressure method called HPP (High Pressure Processing). This process guarantees a juice that's safe to drink, without reducing its nutritional benefits or fresh flavor. Now, on to more pressing issues... How does it taste? Simply put, Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Cantaloupe Juice tastes fresh and refreshing! The bright orange liquid (it's not thick, like a smoothie) has a fresh-sliced cantaloupe aroma and taste. Yum! In addition to serious refreshment and fantastic flavor, this juice also delivers plenty of vitamins A and C and has no added sugar, colors, flavors, or preservatives. A single question remains: With all the trendy cold pressed juice bars popping up, why choose to buy your juice from Trader Joe's? 15.2 ounces of 100% juice for just $3.99-that's why!

Perfect Bars® are sweet, moist, and satisfyingly dense. The Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar® is made primarily of (you guessed it!) peanut butter, which thickens and binds with the addition of honey, organic nonfat dry milk, organic dried whole egg, organic rice protein, various organic oils, and a blend of or- ganic whole food powders (think: spinach, kelp, apple, orange, etc.) You'll also find that each bar is upgraded with a pinch of sea salt and rich, organic dark chocolate chips. Mmmm, chocolate... Perfect Bars® are gluten free, kosher, and non-GMO. They're cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any added preservatives or emulsifiers-and because of this, these bars should be kept in the refrigerator so that their flavor and consistency remain intact.

That's why, every year, we offer Trader Joe's Fresh Squeezed Lemonade. It's made for us by a third-generation, family-owned grower and manufacturer of fresh- squeezed juices, who provides it to us unpasteurized - a decision that makes all the difference in allowing that pure, sweet-tart, summer-sensation-summoning flavor to shine through. Made with only three ingredients (sugar, water, and lemon juice), our Fresh Squeezed Lemonade's refreshing simplicity allows for even further refreshment via customization. For instance, try muddling it with a bit of fresh mint or rosemary, mixing in your favorite fresh fruit, or finding your perfect ratio of Lemonade to tea. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "According to his thirteen children-a handful of whom grew up to found Perfect Bar®, LLC-Dr. Bud Keith was a health food guy before \"health food\" was a thing. He was constantly tinkering with healthy recipes to feed his king-sized family. As the story goes, one day, he ground up a bunch of dried fruits and vegetables, mixed them with freshly ground, organic nut butter and honey, took one bite and declared, \"It's perfect!\" With that, Perfect Bars® were born. Perfect Bars® are sweet, moist, and satisfyingly dense. The Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar® is made primarily of (you guessed it!) peanut butter, which thickens and binds with the addition of honey, organic nonfat dry milk, organic dried whole egg, organic rice protein, various organic oils, and a blend of or- ganic whole food powders (think: spinach, kelp, apple, orange, etc.) You'll also find that each bar is upgraded with a pinch of sea salt and rich, organic dark chocolate chips. Mmmm, chocolate... Perfect Bars® are gluten free, kosher, and non-GMO. They're cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any added preservatives or emulsifiers-and because of this, these bars should be kept in the refrigerator so that their flavor and consistency remain intact. They can last up to one week at room temperature, though, so don't be afraid to toss one in your purse, backpack, or workout bag. We're selling each 2.3-ounce Dark Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Perfect Bar® for $1.99-less than you'll find these delicious slabs of peanut butter-y goodness anywhere else. 07.05. 17",

There's the fact that each bite is a little different than the one before it, and that the mix as a whole is even tastier than the sum of its parts. In fact, we found that there are so many things we like about snack mixes, that that's precisely the ethos we took in creating our own: Trader Joe's Many Things Snack Mix is a tantalizing on the classic snack mix formula that focuses on flavor, variety, and that grander sense of balance that keeps you coming back for more. Inside each pouch of our Many Things Snack Mix, you'll find a familiar array of individual snack pieces, including mini pretzels, bread crisps, corn sticks, and multigrain cereal squares. Where our Mix differs from most, however, is in its embrace of contrasting elements. Trader Joe's Many Things Snack Mix is a little less salty, and a litte more welcoming of sweet and spicy: we've also included honey roasted peanuts, and the cereal squares are divided into spicy and honey butter flavors. Altogether, every bite is a carefully orchestrated, yet gloriously unpredictable, blend of flavors and textures - just the thing to remind you that snacking is a many- splendored thing. Indeed, there's so many things to love about Trader Joe's Many Things Snack Mix, not least of which is the price: we're selling eight-ounce resealable pouches for $2.99*, every day.

Trader Joe's Baked Cheese Crunchies prove that we can fit bold cheesy flavor in a bag without sacrificing a guilt-free production process. These snappy snackers have the great cheesy flavor and the crisp crunch of the cheese puffs of leading brand names.

At some point. Like, at least once.) At Trader Joe's, we're inclined to agree with them. We've been known to push the snack-innovation envelope over the years-stocking our stores with exotic eats from around the world-but when all is said and done, there really is something to be said for the classics. And our Reduced Fat Cheese Puffs is a snack for the ages. Trader Joe's Reduced Fat Cheese Puffs were initially conceived as an alternative to those other puffs on the snack scene-you know the ones. We loved those big-brand puffs just as much as the next Joe, but what we didn't love was their ingredients. Inspired, we set out to create a Puff of our very own, made without artificial flavors, artificial preservatives, and MSG, and using colors derived only from naturally available products. We toiled and tinkered to get them just right, and in 1999, our Cheese Puffs as you know and love them were born... Charmingly cheesy, craveably crunchy, and nutritionally reasonable (we're talking 45% less fat than regular cheese puffs here, people), Reduced Fat Cheese Puffs are just the ticket for mindless or mindful munching. They're baked (not fried), and a one-ounce serving (about 35 Puffs!) contains 130 calories. We're selling each 5.5-ounce bag of Reduced Fat Cheese Puffs for the pile-'em-in-your-pantry price of $1.99- the same price we've held for nearly twenty years.

Trader Joe's GIANT Peruvian Inca Corn descends from this illustrious corn kernel snacking tradition. And as their all-caps first same suggests, they make a particularly big impression. Yes, the kernels of white Peruvian Corn (AKA Choclo or Cuzco), grown exclusively in the Andean Mountains of Peru, in a place called The Sacred Valley of the Incas in Urubamba, are GIANT. They are almost five times bigger than flatland-grown North American corn to which we are accustomed. Their physical magnitude is matched by their flavor and texture. Robust with corn-y nuttiness, their natural heftiness translates into radical crunch. And because the GIANT Peruvian Inca Corn undergoes to a specialized pressure process before being roasted with salt, that crunch is compellingly more crispy than dense. Salty, nutty, corn-y, compellingly crunchy - these are the kind of snack that you start eating and can't stop. That is to say, every impression they make is positive, and that includes our price.

Not only because of our commitment to creating a jerky with minimal processing while leaving out all artificial ingredients, nitrites, added MSG and hormones, but because its, simply put, darn tasty with its smoky flavor and moist texture. Our supplier hand-cuts quality cattle beef cuts and then tosses it in a marinade blend of soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and seasonings for no less than 24 hours. The marinated beef strips are then laid onto screens, placed in a smoke house and cooked super slowly, at very low temperatures, and finally packaged immediately to retain as much moisture as possible. Cooking it in this fashion allows the beef to cook thoroughly, without drying it out and becoming unpleasantly chewy. Once that packaged Trader Joe's Teriyaki Beef Jerky hits the shelves, have a field day hunting for all the opportunities you could sneak the resealable bag around - in your purse, your office desk drawer, under your sweater into the movies, there are limitless locales to snack in! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Based on Will's logic: if medleys are a mixture of music, and music is the food of love, then Trader Joe's Rice Cracker Medley must be a mixture of love. Assuming we're adding up the notes correctly, this snack is exactly what you need to play on... Keeping rhythm with the changing times, we transitioned our old Oriental Rice Crackers [sku 06955] to a new Medley. This freshly improved recipe struck a chord with us, partly because it's gluten free, vegetarian, contains no fat, has 2 grams of protein, and has only 1 gram of sugar per serving. Embracing a Japanese flair, the flavor is right on beat, comprised of a mixture of crisp Rice Crackers flavored with soy, salt, vinegar, and chili. Throughout, you'll also find wasabi green peas, and nori- (seaweed) wrapped crackers. The Asian-inspired flavors, combined with an amusing variety of shapes, colors, and textures-all with a gratifying, crispy crunch- leave your mouth singing.

We aren't talking about the digits of British nobility or, for that matter, sweet-sponge biscuits (that would be ladyfinger, after all). In fact, we're referring to the edible green seed-pods of Okra, better known in many English-speaking parts of the world as \"Lady's Fingers.\" These elegant, phalange-shaped vegetables are a southern cuisine staple, revered for their earthy, green bell pepper-y taste (that is, revered by those, who aren't reviled by the distinct sliminess of the natural juices). Slime? Sorry, no thanks. And this brings us back to our point-we've discovered a manner to make these Lady's Fingers so lovely, you will just want to devour them.

   "description": "Seaweed grows in the ocean-not in fields on land-so the idea of \"organic\" seaweed may seem a little strange. What, then, makes Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Teriyaki Seaweed Snack, \"organic\"? In farming conventional seaweed, farmers typically use food-grade acid to eliminate the presence of unwanted species growing on the underwater crop. Instead of using these chemicals, the South Korean farmers who grow the seaweed for our Organic Seaweed Snack use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys ro- tate, the seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are \"raised\" out of the water, allowing sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it's the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of unwanted species on the crop. Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, and seasoned with organic sesame oil, organic sunflower oil, or- ganic teriyaki powder, and other organic seasonings. The result is a yummy snack that is perfectly salty, with rich umami flavor. This snack is made even more perfect by our packaging-six, 0.17 ounce mini-packs, sold together in one, 1.05 ounce clear package. These little packs are small enough to stow anywhere-lunch boxes, desk drawers, backpacks, purses-but big enough to satisfy your savory snack cravings!

Small and unassuming (much like peanuts themselves), Bamba Peanut Snacks are light, crunchy, and positively bursting with rich, peanut flavor. It's a snack unlike any other, and once you give them a try, even non-elephant types like yourself are sure to have Bamba on the brain. Made for us in Israel, where Bamba is far and away the best-selling snack in the country, Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks contain just four, simple ingredients: corn grits, peanut paste, palm oil, and salt. First, the corn grits are \"popped\" under high pressure, turning them into long rope-like lines of white, puffed, unflavored \"Bamba.\" Next, the Bamba is cut into peanut-sized nuggets and air-baked for 20 seconds in a drying chamber, which gives it an even crispier texture. Finally, the Bamba is moved into large, rotating drums, where they are coated with hot, liquid peanut butter (made from peanut paste, palm oil, and salt). The resulting snack is crunchy, airy, peanutty and highly craveable-kind of like a cheese puff without the cheese. Not only is Bamba is tricky to find in general (most U.S. grocers don't carry the stuff), but it's darn near impossible to find it at a price better than ours-because we're selling each 3.5-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks for just 99 cents.

   "description": "When it comes to chips, there's a tendency to typecast tubers and root veggies into the role. Potatoes, yams, even carrots are so regularly given the chip treatment, that we rarely stop to ask ourselves what other veggies might be due for a starring turn. That's where Trader Joe's Crispy Onion Chips step in. Each one of these petal-like slices of onion have undergone a process called vacuum-frying, which uses lower temperatures and higher pressures to cook food to a satisfying crisp without absorbing as much oil as traditional deep-frying. The result is a light and delicate chip with a delightfully savory (yet characteristically caramel-y sweet) flavor that dissolves deliciously on the tongue. Tasty enough to keep you coming back for more, but light enough to not bog you down, our Crispy Onion Chips were designed first and foremost to be a snack, but that's definitely not their only application. As a topping, they give a serious textural and flavor boost to salads, sandwiches, soups, or anything else you can think of. Our 1.4-ounce resealable pouches of Trader Joe's Crispy Onion Chips are ready for their breakout performance, and you can catch them in our snack aisle. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

We're thrilled that our customers love these delicious, zesty beef jerky snacks and appreci- ate their remarkable convenience factor as much as our tasting panel did, but we would be remiss if we didn't mention that with this praise and excitement came equally powerful calls for a turkey option. The problem was, Chomps® didn't have one. Never ones to take \"we don't make a turkey version\" for an answer, our Buyers rolled up their sleeves and started working directly with Chomps® to develop a brand new snack: ladies and gentlemen, making its grocery store debut, we present to you Chomps® Free Range Turkey Snack Stick! Starting from the drawing board, Chomps® has created a singularly satisfying turkey stick: soft and tender for a jerky, but with a firm outer texture, its elegantly balanced seasonings and spices deftly compliment the pure, savory taste of turkey. Aside from being delicious, they also offer a distinct nutritional advantage over other, less healthy snack choices. Each stick is made with free range turkey raised without antibiotics or artificial hormones, is certified sugar free and gluten free, certified approved for both Whole30® and the Paleo Diet®, and contains 10g of protein for a mere 70 calories. Turkey jerky fans, consider your call answered. Whether you need a post-workout protein fix, a quick morning snack for your commute, or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, Chomps® Free Range Turkey Snack Stick is here for you.

   "description": "Seaweed grows in the ocean-not in fields on land-so the idea of \"organic\" seaweed may seem a little strange. What, then, makes Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt \"organic\"? Well, in farming conventional seaweed, farmers typically use food-grade acid to eliminate the presence of un- wanted species growing on the underwater crop. Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean farmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are \"raised\" out of the water, allowing sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it's the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of unwanted species on the crop. Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, & sprinkled with sea salt (the oil makes the salt stick.) The result is a yummy snack that is perfectly salty and rich in umami. This snack is made even more perfect by our packaging-six, 0.17-ounce mini-packs, sold together in one, 1.05-ounce clear package. These little packs are small enough to stow anywhere-lunch boxes, desk drawers, backpacks, purses- but big enough to satisfy your savory snack cravings!

Instead of being loose in the bag, though, those goodies are adroitly adhered to crisp, rectangular crackers. There are a couple of benefits to this configuration. One, every cheesy cracker contains an assortment of mung beans, sesame seeds, raisins, pumpkin seeds, and cashews - you get all the flavors in every bite. Two, the ease of eating can't be overstated. Rather than pouring out a handful of trail mix or filling a bowl, you need only reach in and grab a cracker. And then another. And another. Genius. Our Buyer first encountered these crackers at a food show in Germany, and brought them to our Tasting Panel post haste. The Tasting Panel approved them, post taste, and now they're available in our snack section. Snack on them straight from the bag, schmear them with a bit of peanut butter, or pair with a favorite mild cheese to really amplify the savory.

What makes us so sure? Because there's nothing not to love here! First of all, you can forget the \"mystery meat\" that you'll find in some name-brand meat sticks; these Sticks are all-beef, and that tender, salty, & mildly seasoned beef comes from strictly grass-fed, grass-finished cattle raised in Tasmania, Australia. And instead of cheap jalapeño powder, the chaps at Chomps® have added bits of real jalapeños to their beef to turn up the heat. Whether you need a post-workout protein fix, a quick afternoon snack, or a mid-hike calorie boost, the meaty, salty snap of a Chomps® Hoppin' Jalapeño Grass Fed Beef Stick is sure to satisfy.

With their addictive crunch and salty, nutty flavor, a bag of Bamba falls squarely into the snackcident- prone category-and the latest Bamba-based addition to our snack shelves is sure to cause cravings and tingle taste buds with abandon. Trader Joe's Bamba with Hazelnut Crème Filling is the same beloved, golden-hued, delicately crunchy, peanutty corn snack from our regular Bamba bags, this time filled with a smooth, hazelnut crème filling. As the story goes, the people of Israel (where Bamba originated) were dunking their addictively crunchy & salty Bamba in creamy hazelnut spread, and cleverly suggested putting the spread inside the Bamba to allow for ingenious, expert-level snack enjoyment, without the mess.

To understand what we mean, just give Trader Joe's Organic Brown Rice Cake Thins a try... For starters, these are square instead of round. They're also quite thin, as their name would imply.

With an unparalelled surface area-to-mass ratio, these light, airy morsels offer a surprising amount of crunch and flavor for something so seemingly slight. And yet, even with all that crunch, puffed snacks like our new Organic Jalapeño Seasoned Corn & Rice Puffs remain decidedly gluten free. We could spend all day puzzling over this paradox, but that time would probably be better spent enjoying these new Puffs' delightfully crisp texture and pleasantly peppery spice and savory undertones of garlic and onion. Our supplier makes these Puffs from a combination of organic corn, rice, and quinoa, and flavors them with a zesty blend of powdered jalapeño, garlic, onion, green bell pepper, and dried parsley, then bakes them until they resemble little golden clouds of snacking goodness. The seasoning blend gives each Puff a superbly savory, herby flavor profile that ends with a nice kick of heat. And aside from being certified organic, our Jalapeño Seasoned Corn & Rice Puffs are also vegan, kosher, and gluten free, and at $1.99* for a 4.9-ounce bag, a genuine value.

Since the 1980s, some version of these crisp, fried, gram-flour flatbreads has been paired with sweet mango chutneys and mint sauce in nearly every UK curry house-not to mention other Indian-style restaurants all around the world. Now-since May 2022-you can pop on down to Trader Joe's for our version of Papadums! Trader Joe's Papadums are perhaps smaller than the large crisps you may have seen presented in a basket at your local Indian restaurant. But other than being one or two-bite sized, these Papadums are made in a traditional fashion. Our Malaysian supplier starts with simple ingredients, making a dough derived from lentils and chickpeas. Formed into thin, chip-like discs, the dough is then fried in rice bran oil, and lightly seasoned with salt and cumin, as is common practice in parts of northern India. The resulting airy Crisps have a lightly nutty taste and a wonderful crunch. And they're an ideal size for carrying your favorite Trader Joe's dip right into your open mouth. For starters, we recommend Trader Joe's Tamarind Sauce [sku 72128], or our Vegan Tzatziki [sku 70634].

Perhaps you haven't given croutons much thought in the past - an entirely understandable position to be in, given that they're hardly ever the focus of a meal. As purveyors (and appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe's Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born. Truly a breakthrough for the medium, these Rosemary Croissant Croutons take everything about a classic crouton to the next level. The buttery, laminated nature of the dough they're made from results in a remarkably resounding crunch. The satisfyingly savory flavor of the rosemary synergizes spectacularly with everything from creamy Caesar salads to zesty tomato bisques or even hearty, homemade French onion soups. But that's hardly all - they're also great when crushed coarsely and used as a topping for scalloped potatoes or a breading for a juicy pork cutlet.

But we got to thinking that rings might be a great way to convey sour cream & onion from snack to mouth, given the also classic nature of fried, restaurant-style onion rings. This way of thinking led to the creation of Trader Joe's Sour Cream & Onion Flavored Rings-only, we decided to rethink the usual breaded and fried approach... While these Rings are indeed round, they don't actually contain a ring of onion. Instead, these mini (about two-bite-sized) snacks are made using red lentils and rice meal. Not only does this mean they are gluten free, it also makes them wonderfully crunchy. They are baked (not fried) and infused with a Sour Cream & Onion seasoning that includes buttermilk solids, onion & sour cream powders, and yeast extract-all of which combine to create an irresistible and inviting flavor.

Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don't break down into an entirely smooth paste.

Hooray!)

But even that level of near-perfection can be improved upon, especially when that improvement involves a dash of spicy, savory seasoning and a crunchy tempura coat. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack!

And, of course, they're always a great bar snack option, especially when served alongisde an ice cold beer, a glass of sake or soju, or even just a fun, fizzy soft drink. Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets",

While we'd never throw shade at a nightshade in any form, we'd like to posit that peckish Peter Piper would have been even more pleased had he picked up a peck-er, a bag-of Trader Oven Dried Red & Yellow Bell Pepper Crisps instead! Made for us in Turkey with three simple ingredients-red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, and sea salt- our Oven Dried Bell Pepper Crisps are an ideal anecdote to a sudden craving for some savory crunch, sans additives. Our supplier takes a 50/50 blend of fresh (not frozen) Bell Pepper slices, sprinkles them with sea salt, then dries (not fries) them in not one, but two separate ovens. (Perhaps we should have gone with Double Oven Dried?) The first pass through the oven prepares the peppers by slowly reducing their moisture levels, and the second dries them to peak crispiness. Snacks don't get anymore straightforward than this... Oven Dried Red & Yellow Bell Pepper Crisps",

After harvest, the nori is dried and roasted with a touch of oil (sesame & canola) and sea salt, then cut into strips. That's it! That's the magic that makes these simple little snacks so mesmerizing; the magic that gives them their light, airy crunch and their intriguing, nutty flavor. Each serving (about half a package) has only 30 calories. We'll warn you, though; the magic within each package of Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack also makes them irresistible, utterly craveable. People can't get enough. Customers have been known to buy them by the case, lest they spend a moment without their favorite seaweed treat. It's true. On top of all that, they're also remarkably portable-try packing them in your lunchbox, backpack or briefcase. And in addition to being a great, on-the-go, vegan snack, they also act as a great accessory to a wide variety of dishes. We like them as a topper for ramen and other savory noodle soups, as well as a vehicle for scooping up bits of fluffy white rice. Roasted Seaweed Snacks with Sea Salt",

Conducive to our quality-plus-convenience cause, our buyers acquired Chomps 100% Grass Fed Beef Snack Sticks. We sought a high protein meat stick without all the icky unnaturalness so common to the genre; but it also had to be of the highest quality and possess great flavor. Check, check, and check! These Beef Snack Sticks contain no nitrites or nitrates (except those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt), and are non-GMO, gluten free and sugar free. The beef is free of antibiotics and artificial hormones, and comes from lean, healthy New Zealand cattle that are 100% Grass Fed. If that wasn't enough, each stick also contains 9 grams of protein and just 100 calories per stick. Finishing off the laundry (or grocery) list of positive attributes, each reddish-brown stick presents a slight smokiness, along with a little kick of spiciness, imparting a distinctively seasoned, beefy savor. Chomp into one and experience a crisp snap that yields to tender, flavorful meatiness. As suggested by their name, these meaty Sticks make a great snack, perfect for that quick boost of protein. Grab one along with an RX Bar [sku 57091] to help fuel you through an intense gym routine, or through your demanding day. For your convenience, we now stock one ounce Chomps 100% Grass Fed Beef Snack Sticks on our shelves for $1.59 each. That's an uncompromising value! 08.04. 16",

The problem was, Chomps® didn't have one.

Pellegrino Sparkling Natural Mineral Water, in its signature green glass bottle, makes a bold statement everywhere it goes.

Inside each bottle is water that takes a 30-year journey before ever reaching its destination. Beginning at the peaks of the Dolomites at close to 4,300 feet above San Pellegrino Terme, the water meanders down the mountain slopes, collecting mineral salts, and eventually reaching the source, where it is enhanced with CO2 before being bottled. Clean and refreshing on its own, S.

At Trader Joe's alone, one can find a host of coconut-based products-from coconut oil, to coconut sugar, to coconut cream, to coconut water. Ah, yes, coconut water. Light, mild, and exceptionally hydrating, coconut water is easily the most refreshing of all the coconut products we carry. But if you think regular coconut water is refreshing, wait until you try Sparkling Coconut Water. And if you think Sparkling Coconut Water sounds refreshing on its own, well, wait until you try Trader Joe's Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. That's right; infused with real yuzu puree, it's anything but the yuzu-al¿ Cultivated primarily in East Asia, yuzu is a round, yellowish citrus fruit whose fragrant, flavorful flesh is prized the world over. Sweeter than a lemon yet livelier than an orange, yuzu is tangy, bright, and delicate (almost floral, some say), making it a welcome addition to summery sauces, dressings, and-yes-beverages. Like our light, crisp, and refreshing Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. And speaking of something refreshing, we don't add any sugar whatsoever to this fizzy delight (we let the coconut and the yuzu do the sweetening), so each can contains just 10 grams of naturally-occurring sugars and 60 calories! Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu is slightly tropical, subtly sweet, and best enjoyed chilled over ice, or in a tropical cocktail. And even if you're three sheets to the wind thanks to said tropical cocktail, we'll wager that you'll always remember this key equation: Coconut Water + Yuzu puree + CO2 = pure, fizzy refreshment. We're selling each 4-pack of 8.45-fluid ounce cans for $3.99-you'll find them in our shelf-stable beverage aisle. 08.28. 18",

These ebulliently bright & bubbly beverages are an easy antidote to a hot summer's day, and with their subtle, fruity flavors that don't overpower (or over-sweeten) the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the everyday act of hydration.

   "description": "The quality of any coconut beverage is entirely dependent upon the quality of the coconut. Fortunately for folks who go nuts for the stuff (as many of you do), Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from only the finest of coconuts, grown on coconut farms in Brazil where the reliably warm climate lends itself to a year-round harvest. The coconuts are plucked and drained of their water, then the water-i.e., the Coconut Water-is pasteurized and blended with a bit of vitamin C to help maintain its natural color. The whole thing is a simple process, really-so when you pluck a carton of Trader Joe's Coconut Water from our shelves and crack it open, it's easy to picture yourself sipping the stuff straight from the source. Its potassium content (about 980mg, or 20% of the recommended daily value, per carton) and convenient, grab-and-go- format make it an excellent option for post-workout rehydration. It also adds some subtle, coconutty flavor to smoothies and mixed drinks. And here's a #ProTip: no matter how you choose to enjoy it, we recommend chilling our shelf-stable-until-open Coconut Water in the fridge and shaking it well before serving. Cheers! Coconut Water",

   "description": "Wild coconuts (which are not really \"nuts,\" but drupes or \"stone fruit\") have three distinct, physical layers. However, when you pick up a coconut in most stores, you're probably just looking at the hard, brown, inner layer (the \"pit,\" if you will) called the endocarp. When coconuts are young and green, their endocarp is filled with endosperm, which consists of white flesh and a watery liquid that serves as nutrition for the growing coconut seed. In the language of alternative beverages, we call this liquid, \"coconut water.\" Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from coconuts that are grown on a massive coconut plantation in Brazil. Our supplier is situated in a region of Latin America where the climate is ideal for growing coconuts- and this means they get to harvest them year-round. Within a few days of being plucked, the coconuts are drained of their \"water,\" which is then pasteurized and packaged with less than 1% fructose and ascorbic acid. Fructose is a natural fruit sugar already in coconut. Adding a little more helps balance the brix count (and therefore the flavor), which can vary seasonally. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) helps to maintain the water's original color. So... when you pluck this shelf-stable box from our grocery shelves and crack it open, you'll discover 99% juice, with a refreshing and authentic taste! Chill it and shake it well before enjoying a glass, straight up. You might also try blending it into homemade soups, or fruit smoothies when you want to add real, coconut flavor. Each 33.8 fluid ounce (one liter) Tetra Pak® of Trader Joe's Coconut Water is a value at $2.99. Find it in our grocery section, along with our other shelf- stable beverages. 4.23.1 5",

Beginning at the peaks of the Dolomites at close to 4,300 feet above San Pellegrino Terme, the water meanders down the mountain slopes, collecting mineral salts, and eventually reaching the source, where it is enhanced with CO2 before being bottled.

Light, mild, and exceptionally hydrating, coconut water is easily the most refreshing of all the coconut products we carry. But if you think regular coconut water is refreshing, wait until you try Sparkling Coconut Water. And if you think Sparkling Coconut Water sounds refreshing on its own, well, wait until you try Trader Joe's Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. That's right; infused with real yuzu puree, it's anything but the yuzu-al¿ Cultivated primarily in East Asia, yuzu is a round, yellowish citrus fruit whose fragrant, flavorful flesh is prized the world over. Sweeter than a lemon yet livelier than an orange, yuzu is tangy, bright, and delicate (almost floral, some say), making it a welcome addition to summery sauces, dressings, and-yes-beverages. Like our light, crisp, and refreshing Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. And speaking of something refreshing, we don't add any sugar whatsoever to this fizzy delight (we let the coconut and the yuzu do the sweetening), so each can contains just 10 grams of naturally-occurring sugars and 60 calories! Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu is slightly tropical, subtly sweet, and best enjoyed chilled over ice, or in a tropical cocktail. And even if you're three sheets to the wind thanks to said tropical cocktail, we'll wager that you'll always remember this key equation: Coconut Water + Yuzu puree + CO2 = pure, fizzy refreshment.

Enter the Secco Strawberry and Raspberry Rossini, a scrumptiously crafted take on the Rossini Cocktail (fun fact, by the way, the Rossini is named after the opera composer Gioachino Rossini, writer of The Barber of Seville!). Whereas a standard Rossini only contains pureed strawberries, we went the extra step and added flavors of Raspberry to make an even more winsome drinking experience. Besides its amazing value, we like to think that the best part of the Rossini, like the Bellini before it, is just how versatile it is. You can serve this chilled before, after, or during pretty much any meal of the day or any occasion in the day that calls for drinks. With its beautiful frosted glass packaging (and exceptional price point), it's the perfect wine to bring to a party, be it by the bottle or case. Make sure your customers don't miss it!

   "description": "Following World War I, French workers rebelled against the upper crust for low wages and poor working condi- tions. By the early 1920s, the workers' strikes had won important reforms, including strict limitations on long and grueling work hours. Under the new laws, French bakeries were forbidden to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Un- fortunately, well-rested bakers also meant that traditional French boules (round loaves) would not have enough time to bake before breakfast. Some historians suspect that this turn of events gave rise to the popularity of the baguette-a long, thin loaf with a shorter baking time-a shoo-in for the new breakfast-bread favorite among the French. Today, baguettes are a favorite nearly everywhere, all the time. At Trader Joe's, our conventional baguette has always been the best-selling item in our artisan sections. Now, we have the opportunity to offer a version made with organic, unbleached flour at a highly competitive price. Each 11.5-ounce Organic French Baguette is an amazing $1.99. While that's a price that post-War French workers could never afford, the average 21st century American should have no problem.

We've attached certain bread-identities to certain meals: i.e. Buttery croissants are associated with breakfast; Biscuits go with dinner. But, just like cars or people or movies, many bread types don't always fit their stereotype. Trader Joe's Sliced French Brioche is one of those wonderfully adaptable breads for any occasion. Our Brioche dough is rich in eggs, butter, and vegetable shortening; a combination that makes it moist, buttery, and slightly sweet. This classic, braided loaf is made in France, where brioche is typically eaten as breakfast, or dessert, often with tea -though it is also used for warm appetizers, or with meat, such as foie gras or sausage. One thing that sets this Sliced French Brioche apart, is that it is packaged in a hermetically sealed environment, blessing this bread with 10 days of shelf life-even without any preservatives! This is one of the freshest loaves you can buy. The uses for our Sliced French Brioche are only as limited as your creativity. Make some French toast in the morning. Pack some English Coastal Cheddar Cheese [sku 080620] between two slices for decadent grilled cheese. Make some cinnamon toast for a snack. Taking advantage of the sweet nature of this bread, you might also top it with some whipped cream and sugared strawberries for a delicious, easy-to-make shortcake. At Trader Joe's, super-versatility doesn't equal pricey. Each loaf of Trader Joe's Sliced French Brioche is $3.99. You just won't encounter brioche with better quality at a better price.

And on top of all that, they're entirely organic. Each bag of Organic French Rolls contains six soft, crusty, artisan-style Rolls, ready to be served at the dinner table (or anywhere else where baguettes are called for) immediately. We would be remiss, however, if we didn't suggest giving them an extra flavor boost by lightly toasting them in an oven at 400°F for three to four minutes just prior to eating. Each French Roll is perfectly sized for making mini-sandwiches and sliders, be it with your favorite deli meats and fixings, burger-based accoutrements, or, our personal favorite, leftovers from the night before. Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Organic French Rolls to our already-illustrious collection of artisan- style breads.

   "description": "Let's take a moment to focus on Focaccia - which, as it turns out, is a pretty etymologically appropriate thing to do! The Italian word focaccia is derived from the original Latin word focus, which referred to the central hearth of a home, where the majority of a family's cooking was done. Indeed, by definition, focaccia (or panis focacius, as the Romans called it) was associated with the warmth and comfort of home from the very start. In that same tradition, we're setting our focus on the warmth and comfort of this soft, savory bread with Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan. Harkening back to its Ancient Roman roots, Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread is baked on a heated tile inside of a blazing hot, stone hearth oven. These conditions allow the bread to form the crisp, light crust and soft, airy crumb texture that focaccia is famous for. Our supplier also upholds an equally important (and delicious) tradition by topping each loaf with extra virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs, flavorful roasted tomatoes, and a generous dusting of finely-grated Parmesan cheese. Put together, each bite is a marvelous mix of iconic Italian flavors, perfect for serving alongside pasta, dipping into a mixture of olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena [sku 12800], or slicing and lightly toasting for use in sandwiches. Now that we've focused on Focaccia, let's take a moment to focus on value - we're selling each 14-ounce loaf of Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan for $3.99.

   "description": "In order to understand what makes Trader Joe's Chocolate Croissants so special, it's important to examine the way that they're made. Our supplier, a highly regarded bakery in South San Francisco, makes the dough in a completely refrigerated environment, which helps prevent proofing before bake time. As part of the fermentation process, the dough is allowed to mature for 8 to 10 hours to develop full flavor. Then, each Croissant is hand rolled and layered using a traditional French laminating technique. Twenty-four thin layers of dough are layered with superior butter sourced from the Pacific Northwest. In the center of each pastry goes a special semi-sweet chocolate baton from South America. During baking, the butter melts, resulting in a flaky, buttery pastry-golden brown, crisp, and slightly bubbly on the outside with a soft, airy crumb (interior). Of course, the middle presents a melty bite of chocolate. Our Chocolate Croissants are fantastic right out of the package, or warmed up just a little. Enjoy with an espresso and a banana for breakfast. Or, warm one up in the afternoon for a sweet treat. Chocolate Croissants",

   "description": "Etymologically derived from the same root word as focaccia, a fougasse is a traditional style of bread originating from southeastern France. Combining the satisfyingly chewy crumb structure of an Italian focaccia with the signature flair of French baking, fougasses where often just as practical as they were palatable, way back when: prior to the widespread use of thermometers, some bakers would use the time it took to fully cook a fougasse to determine how hot an oven was. Now, we can't speak to the temperature measuring abilities of Trader Joe's Olive Fougasse, the latest addition to our bakery section, but we can tell you that its crisp, delicious crust, light, airy interior, and generously distributed slices of Kalamata and black olives make for one seriously delicious, anytime bread. Made in a fetching, four-sectioned design, which can be easily torn or cut into individual servings, our Olive Fougasse makes an excellent accompaniment to practically any meal. It can be served entirely on its own or with a bit of butter for spreading or olive oil for dipping, and can even be enjoyed as an especially flavorful bread for sandwiches. For an even crispier crust, we suggest giving it 3-4 minutes in the oven at 400°F, just prior to serving. Olive Fougasse",

It's a shared moment in every sense of the word: you're sharing time and space in addition to sharing nourishment. So when we find a food that brings the idea of sharing to the fore, as our tear- and-share Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread does, it holds a special place in our hearts. Call us romantics if you must-just don't call us late to the dinner table. To make Trader Joe's Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread, our supplier makes a fluffy, airy, almost focaccia-like dough, sprinkles it generously with shredded cheddar and sliced jalapeño peppers, then chops it into roll-sized pieces. After that, they cobble the pieces together in a tray and bake them just enough for you to finish the job at home. Out of your oven, the bread becomes delightfully warm, the cheese wonderfully gooey, and the jalapeños satisfyingly crisp. From there, you and anyone else you're sharing a meal with are free to pull the pieces apart and enjoy-together. It makes an excellent appetizer option, especially when combined with a fun dipping sauce like our Organic Ranch Dressing [sku 56051], and a delightfully spicy dinner roll option, too.

Each hearty, rustic loaf comes pre-sliced, seasoned with a strikingly savory and herbaceous garlic Parmesan spread, and arrives in a vaccuum-sealed bag to ensure maximum freshness. Once home, all it takes is about 15 minutes in an oven pre-heated to 425°F (or atop a grill set to medium-high heat) before the crust becomes captivatingly crisp, the cheese spread turns marvelously melty, and the garlic grows alluringly aromatic. While other ready-to-bake garlic breads tend to be on the softer side, Trader Joe's Bake at Home Organic Garlic Bread has a firm, chewy, almost ciabatta-like texture. In addition to helping hold the garlic Parmesan spread within its crumb structure exceptionally well, we find that this texture also makes it an even better accompaniment to soups and pastas. Try using a slice to sop up any extra sauce from our Spaghetti Carbornara [sku 75759] or Cajun Style Chicken Alfredo [sku 93370], and you'll see exactly what we mean.

With a kitchen-sink blend of seven seeds and grains, each slice ups the textural ante for toast and sandwiches. Sunflower kernels and flax & sesame seeds are gently roasted to amplify their nutty flavor before uniting with hulled millet and barley, rye, and oat flakes.

Wheeled carts mounted with glass boxes exhibit plastic cups, each one overflowing with one or another combination of fresh- cut fruits and veggies-watermelon, mango, coconut, oranges, jicama, cucumbers¿ But it's not just fruit they're peddling. As important as the produce is, what makes this snack so special is the condiment sprinkled on top. It's a seasoning made from salt, chile powder, and lime juice powder. What might seem strange to the uninitiated is actually a very sensible (and sensational!) flavor fusion: sweet and crisp fruit, contrasted with tart lime, enhanced by salt, and given an ever-so-slight, pungent, chile-powder kick. This seasoning has made its way to the U.S., and beyond. You can find it displayed prominently in Mexican market produce sections as Tajin®. Now, Trader Joe's is providing our own version of this simple seasoning; what we're calling Chile Lime Seasoning Blend. We decided to take the best qualities of the leading brand, and to improve what we could. For instance, our development panel agreed the U.S. version of Tajin® is too salty. Al- though there is a low sodium version, it tastes rather bland. We decided to seek a salt level that would enhance, without tasting \"salty\"... Check! In terms of the overall ingredient list, we exchanged the silicon dioxide in Tajin® for rice concentrate-a more desirable anti-caking agent.

There are alliums that you won't find in the kitchen-ones that add bright purple and pink flowers to spring gardens-but we tend to keep to culinary endeavors rather than horticultural ones. And with that in mind, we've created a new seasoning salt to celebrate these flavorful alliums: Trader Joe's Onion Salt. It may be called Onion Salt, but it has a few other alliums that, in our opinion, make this seasoning truly spe- cial. Granulated onion makes up the majority of this spice, but there's also granulated garlic, minced onion, kosher salt, green onion, and dried chives. Those last few ingredients give the spice its eye-catching green color and an extra kick of flavor. Most other onion salts on the market don't pack so many alliums in, making ours truly unique. Now comes the tough part: choosing just how you want to use our Onion Salt. In addition to using it in place of regular salt when you're looking for a bit of extra onion-y flavor, try any one of the following: Shake on top of your morning eggs. Mix with sour cream or Greek Yogurt [sku 69707]for a tasty onion dip. Sprinkle on sweet potato fries, french fries, corn, or a baked potato. Season hamburgers, steaks, and seafood.

Maybe in your kitchen it's a dash of TJ's Coconut Aminos for umami¿ a pat of Cultured Butter for richness¿or a healthy shake of Everything But The Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend for savory, seedy awesomeness. Soon to join the ranks of awe-inducing, seasoning superstars in kitchens everywhere is Trader Joe's Smoked Paprika. Our kosher certified Smoked Paprika is produced for us on the eastern coast of Spain, in warm Valencia, where our supplier has been working with paprika since 1945. Spanish-grown sweet red peppers are slowly roasted over hard wood planks to imbue this spice with its characteristic smokiness. The peppers are ground into a fine, super flavorful, brick red powder, and then packed into tins with a combination shaker/teaspoon lid, so you can use as much or as little as you like. When you're ready to unleash the power of Smoked Paprika, season liberally during cooking-add it to grilled shrimp, roasted chicken thighs, corn on the cob, French fries, paella¿ anywhere you want smoky, mildly sweet pepper flavor. (It's especially delicious with roasted Dutch Yellow Potatoes, Organic Sour Cream and chopped Parsley.) Like our other superstar seasonings, Trader Joe's Smoked Paprika resides where price and quality (and flavor!) intersect-on our spice shelves.

Umami is the word used to describe the fifth taste - in addition to sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Taken from Japanese, the word translates to \"pleasant savory taste,\" and really, it's just that. And it's really just something you're going to want to put on¿ everything. To create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with kosher salt, and used a flavor base of porcini and white button mushrooms - earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is why we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & black pepper, and thyme. If you follow an eating plan like Paleo or Whole 30, this type of seasoning is a staple. If you follow an eating plan like we do, also known as Anything and Everything, Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend will elevate the flavors of Anything and Everything, a sprinkle at a time.

   "description": "Inspired by all the marvelous mojo-marinated meat we've enjoyed over the years, Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is, as its name would suggest, traditionally tangy, good-n-garlicky, and downright delicious. We first saw these classic Cuban flavors in convenient seasoning form at a Miami mini- market, and we knew we had to make one of our own. Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is essentially a blend of garlic, lime oil, lime juice, onion powder, salt, and red pepper-plus bay leaves, coriander, cumin, cilantro, black pepper, oregano, cilantro, basil, lemon oil, marjoram, and parsley to round it out. It's all the essential flavors you'd find in common Cuban cuisine, packaged in one little 2.25-ounce jar, for one little, $1.99*-per-jar price! You'll find this new blend in our grocery aisle, next to our other private-label, non-irradiated spices. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend",

While the fixins may vary some from vendor to vendor, elote typically comes slathered in mayo or crema, rolled in grated Parmesan or cotija cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero or making elote at home can tell you, it's a highly crave-able combination of flavors that leaves a life-long impression. Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they're usually served on sticks), but last year, we upped the ante on port-elote-ability with Trader Joe's Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers [sku 60564]. Suddenly, customers could enjoy all of that corny, creamy, spiced elote goodness¿ in a chip! The product's popularity was unprecedented. Which got us thinking¿ What other foods could use an elote infusion? Then, like an Everything Bagel in the mist, innovation revealed itself: let folks decide for themselves when & how to add the elote! In the spirit of our Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 59137] that came before it, Trader Joe's Everything But the Elote Seasoning Blend is \"Everything\" you might find on elote-chile pepper, Parmesan cheese, chipotle powder, cumin, dried cilantro, sea salt, etc.-minus the corn itself. (We also add some corn flour & cane sugar, so there's really no mistaking what it's meant to mimic.) You'll find new Trader Joe's Everything But the Elote Seasoning Blend sitting in our spice section, for $2.49* per 2.3-ounce jar. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "There's some serious science behind the fermentation process that leaves fermented garlic as black, soft, and surprisingly sweet as it is. When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, the allicin within fresh garlic - i.e., the chemical that gives garlic its uniquely pungent flavor and aroma - begins to break down into S-allylcysteine, a compound that turns the whitish garlic cloves black, gives them a soft, jelly-like texture, and converts that distinctly garlicky flavor into something sweeter, richer, and more complex. Intrigued? We can't blame you. Luckily, with Trader Joe's Ground Fermented Black Garlic, it's never been easier to add this extraordinary flavor to whatever dish strikes your fancy. A long-standing staple of culinary traditions all across the Asian continent, Fermented Black Garlic makes an excellent addition to even the simplest of foods: soups, roasted potatoes, grilled meats, marinades, even a pot of simple stove top mac & cheese becomes an elevated eating experience with a few dashes of Ground Fermented Black Garlic. In true Trader Joe's tradition, the price remains decidedly unelevated: we're selling 1.02-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Ground Fermented Black Garlic for $2.99*, every day.

   "description": "You might call paprika and chile powder two sides of the same peppery, piquant coin. While both are made with dried, ground peppers, paprika is typically made with a single, relatively milder varietal of pepper, and is usually crafted to emphasize one aspect of that pepper's flavor-sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's super aromatic, and often, it's smoked. Chile powder, on the other hand, tends to be made with a wider variety of peppers, which are usually chosen for their heat level. When mixed together, as they often are in dishes like paella, chili, and shakshua, they express the whole of the pepper's potential. And when carefully balanced into a single spice blend, as they are in Trader Joe's Smoky & Hot Chile Powder, they create a highly versatile seasoning that brings a smoky, savory kick to dishes of all kinds. Made with just the right ratio of smoked paprika and chile powder to create just the right ratio of smoke to heat, our Smoky & Hot Chile Powder is super handy for making savory soups, sauces, and stews, and nearly indispensable when creating homemade BBQ rubs and Cajun-style seasonings. It adds a remarkable depth of flavor when sprinkled over scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, or grilled seafood, and can take snack foods like popcorn and potato chips into an entirely new dimension. Here's a hot (and smoky!) tip: try mixing it with sour cream to make a fun and fiery crema for topping tacos. Smoky & Hot Chile Powder",

As both purveyors and avid appreciators of pizza ourselves, we got to thinking: wouldn't it be great if we could add those zesty, herb-y, unmistakeably pizza-y notes to all kinds of other foods, too? That's when we created Trader Joe's Pizza Sprinkle, a Seasoning Blend that provides the power of pizza in a conveniently Sprinkle-able form. What's the secret? Our supplier makes each batch with a base of tomato powder and granulated garlic to evoke the flavor of tomato sauce, then finishes it with a suite of complementary herbs and spices like oregano, basil, and paprika to evoke a wide range of classic toppings. We recommend shaking it over hot french fries, roasted cauliflower, scrambled eggs, and creamy soups. Looking to bring a little pizza pizazz to your favorite snacks?

Number one on that list: a balanced blend of flavors that complements, rather than overpowers, whatever it's being added to. That's certainly what makes our Salmon Rub Seasoning Blend so great. Made with a base of brown sugar, and supported with seasonings like smoked paprika, dried thyme, kosher salt and black pepper, this Rub synergizes spectacularly well with a salmon fillet, while still allowing salmon's naturally mild flavor and buttery texture to take center stage. With just a quick brush of olive oil and generous sprinkling of Trader Joe's Salmon Rub on a fresh fillet, you're ready to grill, bake, or air fry one seriously delicious piece of salmon. As it cooks, the Rub forms a sweet, savory, herby, and delicately smoky crust that also adds a nice pop of texture to every bite. And while we had salmon in mind while developing this Seasoning Blend, we definitely ought to mention that it pairs beautifully with practically any other protein.

We're glad to announce that now you can 'pop in' to your neighborhood TJ's for a Trader Joe's California Roll next time you're craving maki. Our California Roll is made in the traditional Japanese style, starting with white rice that's seasoned with rice vinegar, and layered with a sheet of dried nori seaweed. Before it's rolled, we add fresh cucumber, avocado, and imitation crab made from Alaskan pollock. It's finished with a sprinkle of white & black sesame seeds. The Roll is sliced into bite-sized segments that are easily lifted with chopsticks (or fingers) to dip into the included organic soy sauce. We've also included a zesty, wasabi-style paste if you want to add a little heat to the sauce. And of course, there are tangy, sweet, pickled ginger slices to cleanse your palate; maybe just before you dig into a Trader Joe's Vegetable Roll [sku 77695]!

These are shaped just like miniature versions of the original, and they maintain the perfect ratio of peanut butter to chocolate. Or chocolate to peanut butter, depending on your point of view. Trader Joe's Mini PB Cups are excellent for snacking - not that you really needed us to tell you that. They also make a superb topping for ice cream - again, not terribly surprising. It may not have occurred to you, though, that these Minis make a deliciously unique replacement for chocolate chips in cookies or brownies (check out our recipe, \"Preposterously Peanut Butter Cup Cookies\" on the official Trader Joe's website for ideas).

Bananas, raisins, peanut butter, and potato chips are just a few items that come to mind. However, there's one classic cocoa-combo with which we've never dabbled: crisped rice and chocolate. It's time. Now, Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate with Crispy Rice raises the bar on that classic flavor fusion. When we tasted the leading crispy rice chocolate bar (not mentioning any names, but it rhymes with Zesty Brunch) we knew we could do better. How to improve on such a classic? As usual, our approach is simple: Find and use the highest quality ingredients. We avoid genetically modified foods and artificial ingredients, to ensure a \"clean\" product. In this bar, we use only non-GMO rice. Our milk chocolate is naturally flavored with real vanilla. And, it is crafted in Belgium by the same manufacturer who makes our Pound Plus bars. Combine the very best choco- late with lots of crispy rice and you get a chocolately-crunchy experience, bar none. By some miracle (we like to call in genius) we've managed to keep the bar high and the cost low.

Answering that popularity, we've chosen to offer up almonds in abundant variety-from raw to roasted to salted to dusted (with cinnamon or chili lime seasoning). Of course, we also sell them covered in choco- late-milk or dark (including a darker, 73% option), or chocolate with sea salt and sugar. There's even a sugar free chocolate version. Do we really need another kind? Why, yes-yes, we do! Trader Joe's Chocolate Coconut Almonds have arrived to fill the coconut-shaped void in our chocolate- covered almond category. Inspired by an iconic twentieth-century American chocolate bar, these bite-sized candies have nuts-two kinds! (Technically, the coconut is a \"fruit,\" but we're not splitting hairs.) To craft these confections, our Pennsylvanian supplier uses a special \"double-panning\" technique. First, our freshly roasted almonds are placed in a dragée (drah-SZAY), or barrel-like drum that is mounted so it can spin. As the drum rotates, a coconut mixture is added to coat the almonds. When the coconut coating is even, just the right amount of rich chocolate is poured into the turning \"pan,\" covering each nut. Bite one of these nutty confections in half and you can see (and taste) each layer-the thin, brown, outer ring of chocolate; the slightly thicker, middle layer of white coconut; the meaty, roasted almond center. It's an ad- dicting addition to our already fine line of candied almonds. To paraphrase an old candy commercial: Sometimes you'll feel like a Chocolate Coconut Almond from TJ's¿ sometimes you won't.

Well, Honey, you're in for a treat-because when you combine all three, you get a crunchy, chocolaty, sweet n' salty treat that we like call Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Honey Grahams with Sea Salt. To make our delicious Dark Chocolate Covered Honey Grahams with Sea Salt, our world-class candy vendor takes (you guessed it!) crisp, bite-sized, square-shaped Honey Grahams, then dips them several times over in (you guessed it again!) rich, top-quality Dark Chocolate until they're sufficiently-read: very generously- enrobed in the stuff. They allow the chocolate-smothered Grahams to cool a bit, and then, as a finishing touch, they top each one with...Can you guess? Bet you can...Yup, you got it! Sea Salt-we top each Dark Chocolate Covered Honey Graham with a sprinkle of coarse, crunchy sea Sea Salt. Whether you ultimately enjoy these Grahams as they come or as bookends for warm, toasted TJ's Marshmallows [sku 56661], we think you'll find that our price is pretty sweet: we're selling each 8-ounce, resealable bag for $3.99*.

Trader Joe's Toffee Chips also start there- crunchy, golden-brown, buttery toffee in the shape of rectangular chips, made from a recipe passed down for generations. Really good. But then, we go and generously coat these Toffee Chips in smooth, rich, milk chocolate or dark chocolate. This takes it up to, at least, super fantastic. Unable to stop ourselves, we finish each piece with a chocolate drizzle that adds more texture to each bite, and also gives Trader Joe's Toffee Chips an elegant look. From a purely objective point of view, this easily notches them above super fantastic-to something that is realistically, probably closer to magically spectacular. Or perhaps even dazzlingly sublime. Wicked awesome might also not be inaccurate. Obviously, Trader Joe's Toffee Chips are delectable on their own. But you might also try them with some fresh fruit-maybe some slices of Granny Smith Apple [sku 90942], for a tart-fruit contrast to these sweet-chocolately Chips. Or try crushing our Toffee Chips over TJ's Ultra Chocolate Ice Cream [sku 78572]. How about chocolate Toffee in your coffee? Dip them in a steaming mug of our Bay Blend [sku 57358].

One combination we're particularly passionate about is chocolate and orange. Specifically, dark chocolate and orange. And, after searching high and low, we've found a new supplier to produce our beloved Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks to our (very high) standards. In fact, they're better than ever, because they just happen to come from the very same confectionary that churns out our wildly popular Scandinavian Swimmers [sku 55691]!

Also, per usual, our Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks don't contain any artificial flavors. Instead, they get their bright, citrusy punch from real orange juice concentrate.

A rich, dark chocolate shell encasing creamy, salty peanut butter-what's not to love about that? Well, if you're allergic to peanuts, plenty! It was this gap in salty, nutty-flavored, chocolatey candy offerings for the peanut-averse that inspired our product developer to create Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups, the newest addition to our candy set. The Cups themselves are formed with rich, fair trade Dark Chocolate, and measure about two inches in diameter. Encased in each Cup is a thick layer of Sunflower Seed Butter, which has been salted and sweetened just enough to avoid the bitterness that sometimes accompanies plain sunflower seed butter. This magical merger of dark chocolate and salty seed butter masterfully mimics the craveable creaminess of a peanut butter cup, without peanuts! And since we're talking about what you won't find in these cups, gluten, dairy, soy, and tree nuts are all absent from the ingredient deck as well. While the nut-free ingredient deck makes these Cups a fantastic addition to a school lunch box, make no mistake-it was their sweet-salty, creamy, can't-stop-eating- them profile that truly won hearts (and stomachs) during our tasting panel. Each kosher-certified, 1.4-ounce package contains two generously-sized Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups, one for you and one for a friend (whether you share the second Cup or not is entirely up to you, of course).

For these less discriminating (though no less avid) coffee lovers, we're offering Trader Joe's Coffee Lover's Espresso Beans. Our confectionery experts in California start with 100% Arabica beans from Brazil. These beans are given a dark roast, as one would find to be typical of coffee used for brewing espresso. Next, the roasted beans are enrobed in an assortment of high-quality chocolates (dark, milk, white) with additional flavors meant to suggest a variety of sweet coffee combinations. The black ones are dark chocolate espresso beans. The brown ones, made with milk chocolate, capture the essence of cappuccino. The tan-colored ones evoke a caramel latte flavor-while the white speckled ones stir up taste-memories of coffee & cream. In addition to providing these crave-able coffee flavors, our assortment of chocolate-covered Espresso Beans can also provide that much-needed mid-morning or afternoon boost¿ caffeine, y'know!

These Oat Chocolate Bars are made by our bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia who combines cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 40% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate) to create a very delicious chocolate bar. The trickiest part is that they use a combination of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat \"milk\") to make it lusciously creamy, just like milk chocolate. Only, there's no milk! Nor is there any soy or gluten in these totally vegan Oat Chocolate Bars. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Oat Chocolate Bars",

   "description": "Bamba Peanut Snacks are light, crunchy, and positively bursting with rich, peanut flavor. This is truly amazing when you realize they're made from just four ingredients: peanut butter, corn grits, sunflower oil, and salt. There's really no reason to add anything else to these nearly perfect peanut puffs... unless that something else is chocolate. So, we did! The longer side of each Dark Chocolate Bamba is dipped in dark chocolate. The smooth, semi-sweet chocolate provides a lovely contrast to the crunchy, peanutty flavor. Enjoy them by the handful whenever you're in a Bamba mood, but craving something just a little bit sweeter. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

But there's actually more to this candy story. What their title doesn't tell you is that each piece also comes in one of several pleasing pastel shades (pink, blue, green, yellow) that have been created using dyes derived from beet juice, spirulina, and other fruit and vegetable juices. These candy shells are also speckled, like tiny birds' eggs. In fact, these Candy Coated Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds end up looking just like miniature Easter eggs! Our Candy Coated Dark Chocolate Almonds are an ideal candy treat to reach for when you need a couple bites of springtime sweet.

Some solve it by eating something salty, followed by something sweet... often followed again by something salty, etc. At Trader Joe's, we know this conundrum well, and we propose Snacky Clusters as another solution to the salty-sweet snacking cycle. You shouldn't get caught in circular snacking with Trader Joe's Snacky Clusters because each piece includes both salty and sweet elements. We've taken Sea Salt Potato Chips, Corn Chip Dippers, and Mini Pretzel Nuggets, and crushed them, then we've mixed everything with creamy milk chocolate and divided the resulting combination into bite-sized Clusters. The upshot of this innovation is that each bite begins with smooth, sweet chocolate, and is quickly followed by the salted crunch of Chips and Nuggets. Snacking conundrum solved! Of course, it's possible that we may have inadvertently created a new snacking cycle that goes like: Trader Joe's Snacky Cluster, followed by another Trader Joe's Snacky Cluster... often followed again by a Trader Joe's Snacky Cluster, etc. Snacky Clusters",

It's made for us by the same Belgian supplier that makes our Pound Plus Chocolate Bars, so you know it's a quality Bar.

But since good candy is so often characterized by excess, you may wonder why we would choose moderation when creating this nutty, chocolatey treat. The answer is... you. More and more customers have been asking for less and less-when it comes to sugar content, and other nutritional aspects considered by some to be less than desirable. And so, we decided to create some Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds with notably less of the less desirable stuff-while still providing a really significant snacking experience. To a substantial degree, we believe we've succeeded! Our supplier dry-roasts California Almonds, then pans them (tumbles them in a barrel with chocolate), and finishes them with a dusting of cocoa powder and sea salt. The chocolate-to-nut ratio ends up being about 20/80. (Typically, chocolate covered nuts are around 66/33.) Nutritionally, this means that each 150-calorie serving (28g) contains just 4g of sugar. Compare these with our Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds [sku 56016], which have 11g sugar per serving (30g). Experientially, this means each Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almond that you pop in your mouth has a delightful crunch, with enough salty sweetness to more-than-slightly satisfy your snack cravings!

A dairy-defying feat of deliciousness, the oat-based Chocolate is impossibly smooth and creamy, just like milk chocolate-but without milk! Building upon that bodacious base, our buyer worked with the same bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia to develop a crispy counterpart, in the form of Trader Joe's Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs. Made with cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 42% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate), the addition of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat \"milk\") makes these Bars lusciously- dare we say, ludicrously-creamy. Bite into one of these Bars, however, and you'll experience a terrific textural transition from magnificently smooth, \"I-can't-believe-it's-not-milk\" chocolate to the delightful crunch of the included Crispy Rice and Cocoa Nibs, along with a touch of sea salt. Like their forebears, these Bars are vegan, soy free, gluten free, and kosher (pareve). They're also presented as a three-pack of individually wrapped bars for easy, on-the-go enjoyment.

So you can imagine our delight when our product developer presented what is now Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate Covered Honeycomb Candy to the tasting panel! To craft this nostalgic treat, a thick syrup of sugar and honey is first boiled, and then combined with baking soda when it's removed from heat. The mixture is poured into trays, and as it cools, the baking soda dissolves, leaving behind air pockets (reminiscent of a Honeycomb!) that create the Candy's signature appearance and delightful, airy-yet-crispy texture. The aromatic, deep golden Honeycomb Candy is then bathed in rich Milk Chocolate, creating an irresistible juxtaposition of creamy and crunchy textures and caramel and chocolate flavors that's quite enjoyable on its own, or when paired with a strong cup of tea.

In terms of flavor, there's the earthy, delicately sweet notes of a finely roasted pistachio, which plays remarkably well off of the rich, ever-so-slightly bitter elements of dark chocolate. And texture-wise, the tooth-sinking smoothness of dark chocolate superbly rounds out a pistachio's tender interior after its initial, delicately snappy bite. It's like they were made for each other-a match made in snacking heaven, if you will. We certainly will, which is precisely why we've introduced Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Pistachios to our shelves. Inside each pouch, our supplier has smothered shelled, dry roasted, and salted California Pistachios in a perfectly proportioned layer of deep Dark Chocolate so that each balanced bite takes your taste buds on a trek across the sweet-salty spectrum.

Delish. If that were the end of this sweet story, we'd be satiated. But there's more to this tale.

   "description": "A (big) handful of Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups for 99¢ - what a gift! They really are. That's why we brought in the small package of individually-wrapped (in shiny foil) cups for the holidays. They were a hit. Customers would grab them for stockings, make them into tasty gift tags or just stick them in their purse or pockets and carry them back to work, the park¿ some only made it to the parking lot before they began peeling away the cheerful wrappings to take a bite. Such exuberance deserves recognition. That's why we're bringing back the 99¢ 3.5 ounce bag of cheerful, foil-wrapped Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups for every day. They're the very same Peanut Butter Cups that we've carried in our tubs for decades. Made for us by an accomplished confectioner in Pennsylvania, these cups are coveted for the proper balance of premium chocolate and smooth, nutty peanut butter. The dark chocolate is made with 50% cocoa solids, so it's rich with a pleasing bitter bite that perfectly complements its sweet, nutty center. Made with roasted peanuts that are ground into a thick, creamy consistency, it tastes like real peanut butter. It is real peanut butter. They're just so good. And now, they are available in a easy-to-grab, 3.5 ounce pouch for 99¢ every day - what a gift!",

One, they're all known for their intense flavors and high levels of antioxidants. And two, they're all featured in Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Powerberries, a sweet-tart treat that's somewhere between a superhero and a super snack. This snack comes in a resealable bag to munch and save for later or try adding these Powerberries to TJ's Unsweetened Instant Oatmeal [sku 56541] or Greek yogurt to build some sweet, rich, fruity and chocolately flavor.

The juices of Açai, Pomegranate, Cranberry, and Blueberry are combined to make sweet-tart pieces that are an excellent source of Vitamn C. Each tasty morsel is individually enrobed in luxuriously smooth Dark Chocolate - which also happens to be a source of cocoa flavanols. We're powerfully certain that you won't be thinking of vitamins when you eat them, though.

   "description": "Around 2015, the maple syrup industry initiated a shift in its labeling. Before then, there were three \"grades\": A, B and C. The trouble was, while these grades simply referred to color and flavor, consumers often thought each letter had something to do with quality. To avoid confusion, a new system was created in which all maple syrups are called \"Grade A,\" followed by their specific color and flavor designation. Here we have Trader Joe's 100% Maple Syrup - Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste (first presented in 2006 under the old labeling system). This is the second lightest (both in color and flavor) of the four Grade A syrups. Its lightness is due, in part, to having been tapped mid-season. (Syrups start out lighter and become darker as the season progresses.) Given its particular qualities, this Maple Syrup works well for most eating occasions- from pancake topping, to Old Fashioned sweetening. We're selling each eight fluid-ounce bottle of Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste 100% Maple Syrup for $4.99*. Find it in our grocery aisle. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

Most of what's marketed for use on pancakes, french toast, and waffles has no actual maple in it at all, unless you count the artificial maple flavor - we don't. At Trader Joe's, our maple syrup is just that, a single ingredient gift of the trees that adds deep sweetness and enormous joy everywhere it's poured. Since our customers loved our 12-ounce Maple Syrup with Dark Color & Robust Taste [sku 89792], we decided to offer a 32-ounce version, that's nearly three times as much! This 100% Pure Maple Syrup is also made later in the season, when the sap coming from the trees has a lower sugar density and higher water content, and needs to be boiled for longer periods of time to ensure appropriate water evaporation. The longer cooking time gives the Syrup its darker color and richer flavor, which make it excellent as a baking ingredient, in a glaze for meat & vegetables, in your coffee or tea, or in marinades & dressings. Trader Joe's 100% Pure Maple Syrup come from the Canadian province of Québec, source of more than 70% of the world's maple syrup. They know their sap.

   "description": "We sell a lot of maple syrup from Canada-and why not? So many quality syrups are derived from north-of- the-border sap. But here in the U.S., Vermont is the place from which the most revered domestic maple syrup comes. Not counting occasional holiday offerings, we carry just one maple syrup from the Green Mountain state: Trader Joe's 100% Pure Vermont Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup [sku 95221]. Our Customers love the taste, but since it's conventional and comes in a rather large bottle (32 fl. oz.) we saw an opportunity to bring in another Vermont option that's organic and less of a commitment size-wise. Trader Joe's Organic Vermont Grade A Dark Color & Robust Taste Maple Syrup is that syrup. It's harvested late in the season, when the sap's sugar content is lower and water content is higher. The longer boiling period required to create the finished syrup results in the darker color and intense flavor. It's an impeccable pancake partner, and an ideal ingredient in maple-focused recipes as well. And, the eight-ounce bottle is on our shelves now and every day for $4.99*. That's an incredible value for an organic syrup from Vermont! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Organic Vermont Maple Syrup",

In short, it's delicious for the green tea lover! Beyond its great taste, this Green Tea also has the bonus of being decaffeinated. Our supplier aggregates excellent quality green tea from key sources including Argentina, India, and Vietnam- depending on availability. The caffeine is removed from the tea leaves using a process that involves exposure to pressurized carbon dioxide, which bonds with the caffeine molecules in the tea leaves, allowing the caffeine to be filtered out via charcoal. Since this process does not involve chemicals, it has no apparent affect on the flavor of the tea. And the fact that there's no caffeine in your cup of Green Tea will have no apparent affect on your ability to go to sleep! *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Decaffeinated Green Tea",

That said, having a super delicious, satisfyingly aromatic tea on hand to stimulate the senses certainly never hurts in that moment, does it? That's exactly why we carry Yogi® Organic Ginger Tea, a remarkably fragrant and flavorful tea blend with a powerfully ginger-y profile. The folks at Yogi® put a lot of thought into the sense of balance within their teas, and this Ginger Tea is no exception. Along with the aforementioned organic ginger, this blend is made with organic lemongrass, licorice, peppermint, and black pepper, which creates a harmonious mixture of sweet and savory influences in one tea. Every sip is a small adventure, an invigorating bolt of spicy ginger and herb notes. Looking to add even more sweetness, spice, or even a nice dose of sour? Feel free to customize with a drop of honey, a dash of cayenne, or a spritz of lemon juice. It's your moment, take it at your own pace.

   "description": "Many of us have come to know Chai Tea as a hot, sweet, black tea beverage that is blended with milk and a variety of spices. In fact, the word Chai simply means plain ol', regular \"Tea.\" This means that when you order \"Chai Tea\" in your favorite local café, what you're really asking for is \"Tea Tea.\" Bor-ing! In India, the beverage is more accurately referred to as Masala Chai, which is translated: \"Spiced Tea.\" At Trader Joe's we've considered all these etymological facts and created a more accurate conflation of language for our own standout version: Introducing Trader Joe's Spiced Chai. Yes! Like original Masala Chai, ours is a blend of warm and lively spices, mixed with black, Assam tea. The spice mixture-cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, Chinese Star anise, black pepper, and nutmeg- enriches the black tea and produces a complex and creamy finish when also combined with milk and sugar. Traditionally, Masala Chai is made by decoction-simmering water, loose-leaf black tea, milk, and whole spices all together in one pot. This wonderfully organic process is a little bit unwieldy when all you want is a little cuppa tea. Our simple solution is tea bags: 20, individual bags, each filled with all the Masala goodness necessary for a fantastic, mind and body-warming cup.

This rhizome (underground, rooted stem) is in the ginger fam- ily-and looks it, too, except for the striking orange color beneath its skin. Mix turmeric with cousin ginger and put it in in curries or in your grilled chicken rub, and you'll get an invigo- rating, fragrant, (brightly colored) result. Mix turmeric with ginger and put it in hot water, and you'll get the invigorating and fragrant Trader Joe's Ginger Turmeric Herbal Tea. Actually, it's not tea, per se-since there are no leaves of a tea plant in these steeping bags. Steeped in hot water, our bags produce a \"tisane,\" aka an \"herbal infusion\"; what most people (not to mention we) call Herbal Tea. Now, since we are being completely thorough, we should also mention that our Ginger Turmeric Tea is signifi- cantly more than just ginger and turmeric. It also incorporates licorice root, orange peel, orange oil, and black pepper-all of which are 100% organic, as a matter of fact. By placing one \"tea bag\" (there are 20 in the box) in an eight ounce cup and adding boiling water, you're making a caffeine-free beverage that is ready to sip in 3-5 minutes. The ginger will revitalize, while the turmeric awakens with its aromatic quality. Sound inviting? Then, we invite you to experience a cup for yourself.

   "description": "Tea is important in Japan. It's at the center of communal life, providing a key ritual (literally) around which friends can gather. Each fleeting meeting is viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and thus, deeply cherished. The common Japanese idiom, Ichi-go, Ichi-e (meaning, \"one time, one meeting\") provides the perfect description of this treasured tea time. We resonate with this value for meaningful human interaction-just visualize your last interaction with one of our friendly Crew! So, we're doing our part to help facilitate more such meetings among friends. Toward that end, we think our new Matcha Green Tea is a great start. It's hard to find time to slow down and taste the tea in your busy routine, but these individual packets of real Matcha Green Tea provide an easy way to brew an authentic, quality cup-anytime, anywhere. Our vibrant emerald-green tea powder comes from tea leaves that are grown and ground for us in Japan. Brewed, it has a rich taste that presents a delicate hint of sweetness. Each 1.5 gram packet (there are seven in the box) is the perfect amount to mix with eight ounces of hot water for a steaming cup of Matcha... better make it two! Ichi-go, Ichi-e. For cold tea on-the-go, you can simply pour a packet into a water bottle (filled with cold water), replace the cap, and shake until blended. Per packet, there are zero grams of fat, zero grams of cholesterol, and only five calories. And per packet, you're paying less than a dollar since the entire 10.5 gram box of seven is $6.99. If you've been looking for a good excuse to come together, look no further than Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea! 01.23. 17",

In Morocco, hosts, shop owners, and teahouses take great care in the process of brewing mint tea and serving it to anyone who walks through their doors. Tea is cleansed in boiling water before steeping, with mint leaves and sugar added to yield a sweet, flavorful drink. Such great care yields spectacular tea. Tea that we, in turn, wanted you to experience, too. With Trader Joe's Organic Moroccan Mint Tea, we've simplified a few of the accustomed brewing steps, de- livering full flavor in the handy form of a tea bag. Our supplier first sources organic spearmint from the Pacific Northwest-because mint tea isn't complete without some of the finest mint leaves around. Organic lemon- grass-which adds a bit of zest-and organic green tea from South India complete the trifecta of ingredients inspired by traditional Maghrebi mint tea. When brewed, this tea is delightful, refreshing, and oh-so minty. If you'd like to achieve the time-honored sweet tea served in Morocco, add a heaping spoonful of Organic Sugar [sku 27042] to your mug immediately after steeping the tea. You won't regret it. Of course, our Organic Moroccan Mint Tea isn't just limited to tradition. Serve over ice with a sprig of mint for a refreshing drink on warmer days. Each 1.27 ounce box of 20 Trader Joe's Organic Moroccan Mint tea bags is only $2.49. That's 19 bags to brew for guests! Or 20 all for yourself.

But the number of ingredients required to create such a concoction from scratch can be daunting. Enter Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate, the next evolution in our concentrated, caffeinated, bottled beverage set (see TJ's Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, etc.). Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate is brewed with filtered water and steeped in small batches to fully develop its characteristic flavors-namely, allspice, black pepper, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. As chai blends can vary depending on who's doing the blending, we've specifically chosen to highlight ginger in our Black Tea Concentrate. This robust rundown of redolent spices is combined with sugar to create the ideal base for a perfectly perfumed, satisfyingly sweet, and altogether tasty Spiced Chai latte. This is where you come in: to create the creamiest Spiced Chai latte at home, simply mix two parts of your chosen base (milk or non-dairy beverage) with one part Black Tea Concentrate and give it a stir. That's it! No fussing with sweetener, no waiting for a proper steep-just pour, stir, and serve. If you're in need of an extra jolt, throw a shot of espresso in the mix to really shake things up. We're offering 16 fluid-ounce bottles (enough to make four 12-ounce cups) of Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate for $2.49-that boils down to about 62¢ per cup!

But given its widespread availability, how does one wade through the ho-hum blends out there to find a high quality cuppa that boils up with the best of them? Why, step inside your neighborhood Trader Joe's, of course! Trader Joe's Organic Earl Grey Tea is a deceptively simple, organic blend of bold, full-bodied black tea from South India, balanced with an invigorating, floral black tea from Africa. The addition of oil from organic Italian Bergamot oranges lends a citrusy, heady aroma (think of Bergamot as the Meyer lemon's warm, spicy cousin) and brightens the flavor of its black tea counterparts-this juxtaposition creates a smooth cup that's enjoyable no matter the time of day. (And if the time of day happens to be teatime, may we suggest serving Organic Earl Grey Tea alongside Curry Chicken Salad [sku 96426] sandwiches (crusts removed, of course), Mini Orange Cranberry Tea Scones [sku 54051], and Lemon Bars [sku 93415]?) For an expertly brewed cup of hot Earl Grey Tea, pour boiling water over a tea bag and brew for 3-5 minutes, then remove the tea bag and add sweetener, or follow British tradition and serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon. If you're on Team Iced Tea, the prep is similarly simple: pour four cups boiling water over 3-5 tea bags and steep for 3-5 minutes, then remove tea bags and pour over ice-filled glasses. At $2.49 per 1.41-ounce box of 20 bags, that's about 13¢ per (hot or iced) cup-an unbeatable price for a cuppa of this quality.

Rather, it's a tisane, made from the leaves of a bush that only grows in certain coastal shrublands near the Cape of South Africa. For another, it has a one-of-a-kind earthy, full-bodied, and elegantly aromatic profile, and just happens to contain no caffeine, too. Inspired and shaped by that uniqueness, Trader Joe's Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend plays to rooibos's natural strengths by adding in a blend of dried hibiscus, rose hips, orange peel, and a bit of orange oil to give a decidedly citric, tantalizingly tangy, and remarkably refreshing character. Because of its lack of caffeine, our Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Tea makes an excellent choice for drinking anytime throughout the day, but we find its toasty orange peel edge is particularly great for sipping during the evening. Similarly, its natural juiciness and smooth profile lends itself to being served iced, or even brewed cold.

   "description": "Located in the northeastern corner of India, Darjeeling is known for its beautiful Buddhist and Hindu temples, dramatic mountain vistas, and, of course, its tea. Blessed with a mild, subtropical climate, and dizzying 4,000- foot elevation, Darjeeling has some of the best conditions on the planet for growing tea leaves, producing blends marked with an elegantly delicate sweetness and herby, refreshing aroma. In fact, Darjeeling is often called \"the Champagne of teas,\" which is certainly an apt comparison point for our fine, bright, and lightly fruity Trader Joe's Organic Darjeeling Green Tea. (Except for the bubbles, of course.) Naturally sweet and rich in antioxidants, our Organic Darjeeling Green Tea serves just as well as a special occasion kind of tea, with cucumber sandwiches and Macarons [sku 51604], as it does your everyday cuppa. We're particularly fond of enjoying it as a morning or afternoon pickmeup, especially when paired with pastries, fruits, or mild and tangy fare: think fresh cut melon, a slice of French Apple Tart [sku 57284], or slices of apple spread with a bit of Fine Herbs Chevre [sku 88544].

   "description": "Much like wine or cheese, the quality of any given tea is highly dependent on its origins. Trader Joe's Organic Assam Black Tea, for example, is grown for us in the state of Assam in northeastern India, where the assamica variety of the tea plant has grown for thousands of years, and which is now the most productive tea-growing region on the globe. Here, the hot, humid climate, relatively flat topography, and proximity to the Brahmaputra river create ideal growing conditions for this Organic Assam Black Tea, resulting in its uniquely rich, robust, and slightly malty flavor profile. Exceptionally delicious when enjoyed as your first morning cup, our Organic Assam Black Tea brews to a dark, golden red and emanates an earthy, spicy aroma that truly invigorates the senses. We find that its full- bodied profile befits pairing with similarly full-flavored fare, like savory breakfast sausage, an omelette with Crunchy Chili Onion [sku 62480], or a plate of chicken and waffles. During the warmer months of the year, this Organic Assam makes an excellent iced tea, too, especially when garnished with a wedge of lemon or lime. Organic Assam Black Tea",

   "description": "Much like a wine or cheese, the quality of any given tea is highly dependent on where it was harvested. For certain teas, however, when it was harvested is just as, if not more, important. For example, during the first few weeks of spring, as assamica tea plants in northwestern India begin to mature, their first flush of leaf buds end in a distinct, golden tip. These golden-tipped leaves are prized for being richer, sweeter, and even slightly higher in caffeine than standard Assam leaves (which are already quite excellent)-and they're exactly what you'll find in every box of Trader Joe's Organic Assam Golden Black Tea. Bold and malty, with a faintly fruity profile, this full-flavored Assam Golden Black Tea is cultivated for us using organic practices in India's bountiful Brahmaputra valley, nestled in the state of Assam (from which this tea gets its name, in fact). It serves just as well hot or iced, as-is or with a splash of milk or your favorite non-dairy creamer. We find that its strong character and notes of toasted rice make it a lovely pairing option for breakfast pastries, fresh fruit, or a nice, sharp Cheddar cheese. And just as timing is important to this tea's harvest, it's also paramount if you want to pick up a box at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, because supplies of this Organic Assam Golden Black Tea are decidedly limited.

Taking its inspiration from the more traditional, South Asian masala chai, our Chai Latte Mix is a blend of black tea, sugar & honey, with a spice mixture that includes cinnamon, clove, cardamom, anise, and ginger. The tea & the spices bring an element of tradition to the mix, but then, the traditional takes a turn in favor of convenience and versatility. Spicy Chai Tea Latte Mix includes milk (hence, the \"Latte\"), so that when combined with hot water, it mixes to a smooth, creamy consistency you don't find in straight tea. Delicious hot or cold, in the warmer months of the year, we especially enjoy it with ice and whipped in a blender to make a chai \"smoothie\" that will rival any you'd buy at a coffee or tea shop. Hot tip (or should we say, cold tip?): when serving it cold, it's still best to prepare the Mix with hot water and then pour the resulting Latte over ice, to ensure a smooth, creamy consistency.

Hav- ing known this for centuries, the Japanese developed a ritual called Chado-literally \"the Way of Tea\"-to celebrate the art of this ancient beverage. Central to this ritual is a very special powdered tea called Matcha. Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix puts this exceptional tea right at your fingertips, for all your mo- ments-whether casual or ceremonious. Many of us associate \"powdered\" beverages with kids' drinks-Kool-Aid, anyone? But, before you decide that Matcha is not your cup of tea, get this: In contrast to coarsely prepared leaves of tea that are meant for steep- ing in a bag or infuser, pure Matcha leaves are milled into a fine powder. When whisked into hot water-as ritualized in Chado-this tea-powder dissolves completely, yielding a wholesome cup that maintains all the nutrients, antioxidants, fiber, and chlorophyll found in the original foliage. It's like eating the leaves right off the tree¿ just less crunchy! Because straight Matcha is a little bitter, we couldn't resist adding some milk and cane sugar to our mix. Com- bine three tablespoons of the powder to 6 ounces of hot water and you'll have before you a creamy, sweetened brew with authentic, Green Tea flavor. Perfect for your next Japanese St. Patrick's Day tea party. Our 8-ounce can is $3.99 and makes four 12-ounce lattes. That's about the same you'd pay for just a single latte at your local café.

We also tend to find that there's no better root to turn to than ginger for making a spicy, invigoratingly aromatic tea. That's precisely why we're offering Trader Joe's 100% Ginger Drink Mix, a ready-to-mix tea powder that's made with dried, powdered ginger from Thailand, and that's it - nothing else. It's the perfect portable powder for ginger purists, or anyone else who's in need of some pure ginger flavor. Similar to how our popular Matcha Green Tea [sku 57159] works, pour the contents of one packet of our 100% Ginger Drink Mix directly into a cup of hot water (cold water will work too, but might take a bit more effort to completely mix in) and stir until dissolved. Immediately, you'll be treated to powerful ginger aromatics and a delightfully spicy, remarkably refreshing drink. From there, feel free to tinker as you see fit: serve it over ice or mix with your favorite fresh juice, kick up the heat with a bit of cayenne, or even cool things down with a sprig of mint. Not only is Trader Joe's 100% Ginger Drink Mix made with 100% ginger, it's also 100% a value, through and through.

But once upon a sleepless winter's night, plagued by a sore throat, our Buyer had a thought: \"What if we were to offer a drop under our private label at a value that can't be beat?\" By morning, he was sold-and once he brought the first iterations of Trader Joe's Cranberry & Herb Supplement Drops to our product tasting panel, so were we. Trader Joe's Cranberry & Herb Supplement Drops are sweetened with sugar and glucose syrup, and flavored with real, tart cranberry juice concentrate, a lively blend of herbs (like thyme, sage, lemon balm, and peppermint), and soothing menthol. They might taste a bit like candy, but they also happen to support the immune system, thanks to the 33mg of vitamin C added to each drop-that's a whopping 37% of the recommended daily value. Next time you're feeling a bit under-the-weather, reach for a Trader Joe's Supplement Drop and rest easy. For maximum throat-soothing potential, we recommend letting the Drop dissolve fully in your mouth rather than biting or chewing it. And, really, these Drops aren't just good for the stuffy, wheezy times in life-they're a Supplement that you can take regularly* in support of that trusty, ol' immune system. We're selling each 15-drop bag of Trader Joe's Supplement Drops for just 99 cents, which comes out to about 7 cents per Drop.

For instance, in a single serving of Trader Joe's Organic Chia Seeds you get eight grams of fiber, four grams of protein and two grams of Omega-3 fatty acids (ALA). Plus, there's an abundance of calcium, magnesium, and antioxidants in there too. These tiny, shiny, black, powerhouse seeds are cultivated for us in Paraguay, the world's largest exporter of Organic Chia Seeds. Paraguay's suitable soils and accommodating weather make it perfect for growing them. The red soil in our supplier's farming area is indicative of its rich mineral content. The weather in the region is warm, including ideal sun exposure and five to ten occasions of rain per month. These conditions guarantee a consistent and nutrient-rich crop. We're also pleased to note that the way our supplier handles their seed production-with well-managed crop rotation, and holistic support to the local farmers-guarantees living wages for farmers and their families, and protects the environment. That's a win for the farmers, a win for our supplier, and a win for you, since you get to sprinkle these super seeds on your yogurt, cereal, and salads, or mix them into your smoothies and baked goods.

Back to versatility: Our Flaxseed Meal easily adapts to a variety of diets. It is vegan, gluten free, kosher (pareve), and paleo friendly. And everyone will benefit from the Omega 3 content. One 2 Tbsp. serving of our Organic Flaxseed Meal contains 3000 milligrams of ALA (a-linolenic acid, essential for the human body). That's a radical 187% of the recommended daily value for ALA!

For instance, these Pastries do not include TBHQ, an artificial preservative you'll find on the ingredient panel of the leading toaster pastry brand.

For $6.49* (plus deposit where required), you'll get twelve cans full of this thirst-quenching Lager. Made by a family-owned brewery in Wisconsin that's been a-brewin' for more than 150 years, it's crisp, easy to drink, and has a well-balanced flavor that pairs swimmingly with both seafood and spicy dishes. And just like in simpler times, this brewer never adds any of the fillers found in some inexpensive beers. We're all for simply terrific beer at a simply terrific price. Here's to Simpler Times! *Simpler Times is currently available in Trader Joe's stores where beer is sold. It is $6.49 to $8.99 depending on market, plus tax and redemption.

They're also known for beers that have been aged in bourbon barrels. Having worked with them in the past on our Hibiscus Tripel [sku 55868], we thought it was time for another collaboration. This time, the fruit of our co-labors is a Barrel Aged Coffee Stout. True to their passion, the Hardywood folks spent time cupping many different Trader Joe's coffees in search of the one that might pair best with a barrel-aged brew. They landed on Trader Joe's Colombia Supremo [sku 50976]. It turns out, Supremo's character harmonizes nicely with the chocolate",

Though it's made for us through a partnership with one of the foremost crafter breweries of the West Coast, it's brewed with imported malt and hops under the strictest interpretation of the Reinheitsgebot, a strict set of laws from 16th century Bavaria that determined that beers could only contain barley, hops, and water. Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe. Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally means: \"wheat yeast\"). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer's unfiltered golden color, combined with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself. It also pairs extremely well with a grilled Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst [sku 57632] or our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage [sku 28287]. Josephsbrau Hefeweizen",

First celebrated in Munich in 1810, the inaugural Oktoberfest was thrown to mark the nuptials of Kronprinz Ludwig to Princess Therese of Saxe- Hildburghausen. Now nearly synomous with beer, Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is an homage to the festival's official drink, known to locals as Märzenbier. In fact, in order to match Märzenbier's marvelously malty profile, the brewers at Josephsbrau have imported three kinds of malts all the way from Germany! Each sip of Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is full-bodied and caramel-y, but with a light enough touch of hops that it remains remarkably easy-drinking. We recommend serving it well chilled, out of the can or in a frosty glass (or stein, if you've got one!), preferably alongside a grilled steak, sausage, or burger.

We heard tell of folks mixing it into brownie batter, blending it in coffee drinks, drizzling it over a sundae¿ This got us thinking: if cookie butter goes well with all those desserts, we bet it would taste great as a dessert beer, too. Lo and behold, that bet has paid off, in the form of our Speculoos Cookie Butter Beer. It's made in collaboration with one of our favorite craft breweries (and an award-winning producer of delicious dessert beers), Hardywood Park. For this impressive imperial golden ale, they use vanilla beans, milk sugar, and toasted coconut to evoke the sweet, caramel-y flavor of Cookie Butter in every rich, flavorful sip.

With Trader Joe's Rainbow's End Trail Mix, however, we decided to flip that on its head. This time, the treasure is a classic mix of roasted peanuts & almonds, plump raisins, and sweet candy-coated chocolates, and it's not only quite attainable, it's a remarkable value. Like any good trail mix, Rainbow's End benefits from an finely tuned mix of contrasting flavors and textures. On the flavor axis, the peanuts and almonds provide a fine, savory nuttiness and salty edge that complement the fruity raisins and candy sweetness of the chocolates. Texturally, the plushness of the raisins plays against the soft crunch and toasty bite of the nuts, which in turn is accentuated by the snap of the chocolate's candy coating. Altogether, it's a pure, simple, and delcious take on a traditional treat.

It's got excellent crunch, and is a super mix to bring with you on that long hike, run or bike ride. It's also good to have around the house when you're looking for a power-packed, nourishing snack. Since everything is raw, there are no added salts in this Mix. Because it's so delightfully unadulterated, we thought about calling it \"Go Naked,\" but our better judgment won out.

And just think of how much she'd appreciate a good Trek Mix as a holiday gift! Trader Joe's Over the River and Through the Wood Trek Mix (and note that that's a singular \"Wood\", as it is in the original 1844 poem by Lydia Maria Child) is an homage to all things sweet, delicious, and holiday-friendly - roasted salted almonds, sweetened dried cranberries, pumpkin pie spiced pecans, roasted salted pepitas (pumpkin seeds), roasted salted pistachios, and white & dark chocolate covered pretzels. There's something in this Mix for everyone - sweet & savory, crunchy and chewy. And it's colorful! Green pistachios and red cranberries take center stage, but those multi-hued chocolate covered pretzels certainly do grab your attention. This is a limited edition Trek Mix we're offering only during the holiday season, so if you're traveling this path, don't dawdle (Grandmother would say \"dawdle,\" wouldn't she?).

Recently, our customers have expressed interest in having more meat options that carry the \"Antibiotic Free\" attribute. Since we've seen positive response to chicken products carrying this attribute, we've decided to take it to what sells really well - ground turkey. Trader Joe's All Natural Ground Turkey is made from turkeys that are raised in the U.S. on 100% vegetarian diets, without the use of added hormones (a federal standard for all poultry), and, most notably, without the use of antibiotics - ever. Minimally processed, the ground turkey contains only a sprinkling of rosemary extract, which is used to maintain freshness and ensure shelf life. A blend of white and dark meat, it's naturally lean (but still cooks up moist and juicy) with mild flavor that welcomes seasoning; perfect for turkey burgers (purportedly a favorite food of both Oprah and William Shatner) meatballs, meatloaf, chili, tacos¿ Since there are fewer turkeys raised on family farms in the U.S. without the use of antibiotics, they are a little bit more expensive, but we made certain to maintain a desirable price for the desired product profile - it's simply what we do. As such, we're selling our Trader Joe's Antibiotic Free All Natural Ground Turkey for the great, everyday price of $3.99 per pound.",

   "description": "Legend has it that the first bottle of Balsamic Vinegar di Modena was valued at 100 horses. That's what the soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Enrico III of Franconia purportedly imparted to the individual who gifted to him a small bottle of \"black vinegar\" in 1046. The value of Balsamic Vinegar was established. Trader Giotto's Gold Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena is a fine example of what's been handed down over the last one thousand years. Sitting between our Platinum Aged Balsamic [sku 53741] and our Red Label Balsamic [sku 12800] in both its quality and its price, our Gold includes the same Indicazione Geografica Protetta (IGP), as do these others. This indication designates a vinegar that's produced in the Emilia Romana region of Italy (specifically Modena, in this case), and that's made exclusively from Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes from this same region. The IGP also means you can count on a vinegar that's been aged for at least three years in oak barrels. All of these qualities are strictly monitored and controlled. These factors culminate in an Aged Balsamic that is naturally viscous like honey (no added thickeners), with a sweet flavor that includes a hint of pomegranate. Enjoy some on fresh strawberries or watermelon. Mix with olive oil and toss with greens for a best-dressed salad. Add a mysterious complexity to your soups and stews by stirring in a tablespoon or two near the end of the cooking time. You'll have tasters wondering what you did to develop such rich and interesting flavor. While similar (lesser quality) products can be found for $20 and up, Trader Giotto's Gold Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena is available everyday for just $5.99.

And not much about the well-known vinegar has changed since! Its enormous success throughout the world can be attributed to the fact that it can be used as a condiment in practically any style of cooking. At its roots, Trader Joe's Balsamic Vinegar of Modena is a reduction of sweet grapes, boiled to a syrup. The resulting \"grape must\" is mixed in exact proportions with the wine vinegar to make the final product. And what a product it is - sweet-and-sour in taste with a rich fragrance that will only add to, not dominate the other flavors in a dish. And of course, with that Protected Geographical Indication, Trader Joe's Aceto Balsamico di Modena PGI is produced in the Modena region of Italy, for an authentically tasting Balsamic Vinegar similar to that introduced to modern history back in 1046 A.D. These factors sing in harmony in every bottle of our Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.

Trader Joe's Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it's certainly not lacking for flavor.

And that's exactly what's inside this squeeze bottle. Balsamic Glaze is made for us in Modena, Italy, home of some of the world's best balsamic vinegar. It's crafted using traditional methods, so it has the deep flavor and pungent aroma you expect. You can, of course, reduce balsamic vinegar over a flame to achieve a similar consistency, but that takes precious time and tends to increase the acidity of the vinegar. Our Balsamic Glaze is ready to use and it preserves an ideal balance of sweet and bitter. It's made by combining concentrated grape must and balsamic vinegar, then using a special filtration process that results in the thicker consistency that makes this Glaze so versatile. Use it on salads, as a drizzle over grilled meat and fish, or as a dessert topping for fresh, summertime berries.

They're a nice dessert option with coffee or tea, excellent with hot cocoa, and they're even good with sorbet or low fat yogurt for dessert. Kids love them in their lunch boxes and for after school snacks. Grown-ups like them any old time. Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat was known for his grin. Chocolatey Cats Cookies will leave you grinning; especially when you see their price of $2.99 for each 16-ounce tub.",

When those cookies are Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Snaps, it's easy to understand the love. These are no ordinary ginger cookies. Our North Carolina-based cookie bakers crafted this cookie for the truest of ginger lovers, using three different gingers - fresh, crystallized, and ground. Triple Ginger Snaps are crispy cookies with a good snap - a given for cookies with Snap in their name - even more so when you serve them with a scoop of our Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576] or Speculoos Cookie Butter Ice Cream [sku 53340]. Or a scoop of each. Some people like to sandwich their ice cream between two Triple Ginger Snaps. Some admirers stock up on cases every time they visit Trader Joe's, just to be sure they don't run out. Ever. And some enshrine their cookies online. These are cherished crisps. And yet, their price belies their quality. We're selling these gingery goodies in 14-ounce tubs for the extraordinarily value-driven price of $3.99 each, every day. You'll find them only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.",

They're big, block letters and numbers, about an inch high, cleverly disguised as cinnamon-flavored cookies. They actually taste a bit like cinnamon graham crackers, with a crunchier, sturdier texture. With only nine calories a cookie, they taste much more indulgent than they really are. They're good with milk, coffee, tea, or ice cream, and it's quite fun to use them to make words and then eat them. You could think of them as edible Mad Libs. Of course, lunchboxes are excellent containers for cookies such as these. You could also enjoy these straight from the tub, on the couch, while binge-watching your favorite show. We've been selling Cinnamon Schoolbook Cookies since 1998 (you know they're good if they've stuck around that long), and 21 years later, these kosher certified crisps are still made with the same recipe and still a fantastic value, at $2.99 for each 16 ounce tub.",

Never ones to scoff at tradition-or a good cookie, for that matter-it only made sense to bring in the cookie behind the craze, and we've been selling Trader Joe's Speculoos Cookies to the delight of cookie fans (and Cookie Butter fans) ever since. Made for us in Belgium, the crisp composition of our Speculoos Cookies is surprisingly simple. The base is composed of wheat flour, baking soda, palm oil, and canola oil, producing a delightfully snappy texture, while the sugar and sugar syrup in the recipe caramelize as the Cookies are baked to a golden-brown hue, creating a craveable, honey-like sweetness that's rounded out with a dash of warm cinnamon and a touch of sea salt. Their thin, oblong shape makes these vegan Cookies a capital accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee or tea or an ice- cold glass of milk.

How do these laws relate to Trader Joe's Fig Bites made with Turkish Figs? We're glad you asked. These cookies, made for us in the American Midwest, will absolutely remain in their package until your hand comes in from the outside and moves them. It is absolutely true that it takes more force (strength) to lift an entire ten-ounce package than it does to lift a single Fig Bite. And that third law? We think that means when you place a Fig Bite into your mouth, a signal is sent from your taste buds to your brain and back into your hand, forcing another cookie to be lifted and brought to your mouth. Perhaps that's equal but not opposite? Whatever it is, we think Newton would approve of these cookies made with soft cookie dough surrounding a chewy, sweet, figgy center. He would probably also like our price of $1.99 for each ten-ounce package, because, really, who doesn't love a great value? 7.13.1 5",

So we say make hay; don't be a shrinking violet; wake up and eat the flowers. Had enough of the flower allusions? Fine. Let's focus on the cookies. We're working with a small-batch bakery in a small village in upstate New York to make these small-ish Cookies. That's where \"small\" ends. The cookies themselves are buttery Shortbread crisps. They're bathed in a sweet yogurt icing, and then topped with colorful nonpareils-not only do the nonpareils add a lively color boost, they bring a bit of extra crunch to the party as well. Some of the cookies are pink, and some are white; hence, their name. They are also kosher (dairy), and are cholesterol free with only 70mg of sodium per serving. Pinks & Whites are sweet, crunchy, tangy, and oh-so-pretty. You'll fall in love with these comely cookies, one petal of yogurt-frosted shortbread crunchiness at a time. Try them with a spot of Chamomile Tea [sku 51468] or our French Vanilla Coffee [sku 51484].

Made for us by the same supplier as our celebrated Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie [sku 58527], Trader Joe's Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling builds on the success of the first by forming a trifecta of rich milk chocolate, peanut butter, and crispy, crunchy wafer cookies. In mixing this tantalizing textural element in with the classic peanut butter and chocolate pair, we've created a candy-cookie hybrid that's so supremely satisfying that it must be tasted to be believed. Each bite of a Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling starts with the sweetness of the milk chocolate, which then leads to the irresistable crunch of the light, airy wafer cookie. As soon as you make it through the satisfying snap of the cookie, your taste buds are met with lightly salted peanut butter to round it all out. It's a sweet experience in every sense of the word, and one that's only enhanced by the addition of a nice cup of coffee.

Soft to the bite, golden to the eye, and delicious to the taste buds, Trader Joe's Soft Bite Mini Almond Biscotti cookies are a delight for all senses. The modern Italian word Biscotto comes from the medieval Latin word biscoctus, meaning \"twice-cooked\". A process that was used to serve the purpose of drying and persevering foods to be stored and remain fresh for long periods of time. Which is a perfectly subtle distillation of the baking process our biscottis undergo. Each Trader Joe's Soft Bite Mini Almond Biscotti is mixed by hand in small batches. Following this, the dough is then twice baked as per traditional biscotti baking methods. It is first baked in a loaf and then cut to bake these cut \"slices\" a second time for that final biscotti texture. However unlike a traditional biscotti, our Soft Bite Mini Almond Biscotti cookies are made to have a more delicate texture. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "As you may know, we get the word \"sandwich\" from its formal invention in the 18th century by John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, supposedly so he could continue to play cribbage without getting meat residue all over his cards. Of course, cooks the world over had combined meat and bread for millennia prior to the Earl's spur-of- the-moment request, but it's a testament to the power of the sandwich's specific construction that we hold onto this name, even some 300 years later. In the spirit of the original sandwich's inventiveness, convenience, and, most importantly, deliciousness, we're keeping the tradition going with Trader Joe's Turkey Apple Cheddar Sandwich, a tasty combo of savory and sweet in one easy package. Inspired in part by the flavors of fall and Thanksgiving (but suited for snacking all year-round), Trader Joe's Turkey Apple Cheddar Sandwich is a charming medley of flavors and textures. Starting with a base of soft multigrain rustico bread, each Sandwich is hand-constructed with layers of aromatic Dijon mayonnaise spread, slices of tender, savory, sliced turkey breast, aged white Cheddar, slices of sweet, crisp apple, and finishes with peppery leaves of arugla and another layer of Dijon spread. Put together, each bite is bright, lively, and balanced, with the savory notes of the sharp, aged Cheddar and turkey interacting wonderfully with the zesty Dijon spread and tart sweetness of the apple slices. Combine that with the interplay of textures from the soft bread, firm cheese, and crisp apple, and you have a Sandwich of such elegant construction, it would elate any Earl. As delicious as Trader Joe's Turkey Apple Cheddar Sandwich is, as convenient as it comes in its grab-and-go, ready-to-eat package, what's truly astonishing is its exceptional value. While you'd be hard pressed to find a sandwich of this quality for under $7.00, we're offering Trader Joe's Turkey Apple Cheddar Sandwich, every day, for $4.99. You'll find them in our fresh prepared foods section. 11.26. 18",

   "description": "With all due respect to a certain amphibian philosopher, the answer to why there are so many songs about rain- bows seems pretty obvious. As meteorological phenomena, they've inspired awe with their seemingly supernat- ural vibrancy and intangibility since time immemorial. As symbols, they're a wonderful metaphor for the vast spectrum of human existence, emotion, and the diversity of life. And, of course, you can't ignore the fact that they're just very pretty to look at. It was with all these factors in mind that when the time came to name our newest vegan wrap, the answer was also quite obvious. We present to you, humans and banjo-plucking frogs alike, Trader Joe's Rainbow Wrap. Expressing a radiant spectrum of flavor, Trader Joe's Rainbow Wrap is, fittingly enough, a visual and edible veggie rainbow. Starting with a base of a robust red beet and flour tortilla, each wrap is hand-packed with fresh, crisp spinach leaves, perfectly roasted slices of sweet potato, sweet shredded beets, and curry-seasoned chick- peas to add a nice kick of spice. Aside from providing a brilliantly mutli-colored feast for the eyes, each ingre- dient contributes to a symphony of flavors and textures, where each bite is just slightly different from the last, culminating in a sum even greater than its individually delicious parts. So, there it is, the Rainbow Wrap connection. A veritably vegan treat, a splendid on-the-go lunch, excellent on its own or with a few drops of our (also vegan) Green Goddess Salad Dressing [sku 59991]. We're selling each 11.5 oz. Wrap, every day, for only $4.49. No need to search for the end of this rainbow; you'll find it in our fresh prepared foods section. 06.06. 18",

   "description": "Hummus truly is an all-star of vegan cuisine. Smooth and creamy in texture, with a savory flavor that can be seasoned and complemented endlessly, it can be a dip, a spread, an appetizer, or a side. And if that weren't enough, it's a source of plant-based protein, too. With that in mind, we're excited to give hummus a role befitting its all-star status in Trader Joe's Creamy Hummus & Vegetable Wrap. Here, alongside its crisp, crunchy, veggie co-stars, hummus gets a chance to shine as the chickpea-powered pro that it is. To make each Wrap, our supplier starts with a vividly verdant spinach and flour tortilla, to which they add a generous spread of hummus that's been seasoned with tahini and roasted garlic. They then add layer upon layer of fresh vegetables, including shredded carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers, red cabbage, and baby spinach leaves. The result is a blend of fresh flavors and varied textures that makes for one satisfying vegan snack or meal, especially when accompanied by a savory sauce, like our Vegan Tzatziki [sku 70634], Vegan Kale, Cashew, & Basil Pesto [59821], or Green Goddess Salad Dressing [sku 59991]. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Far from the condiment's centuries old Eastern European roots, Trader Joe's Organic Sour Cream brings this delectable dairy staple from organic farms to your dining room table - no babushka necessary! Sour cream is created by fermenting cream with lactic acid bacterial cultures that naturally \"sour\" and thicken the starting cream. It has long been an ingredient in Eastern and Central European cuisines, making its way to the U.S. and U.K. through westward immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since been kept on hand to tame picante Tex-Mex dishes, as well as make quick dips and silky sauces. With a pure and simple ingredient list, Trader Joe's Organic Sour Cream delivers the freshest organic and pasteurized cream, milk, corn starch, and live and active cultures ready for you to use on your culinary adventures! Whether you're shaping a savory dish or building a baked good, each 16-ounce container of Trader Joe's pleasantly piquant Organic Sour Cream can be found every day in our dairy fridges for $2.99*. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing.

   "description": "Traditional kefir was made by hanging the milk and kefir grain mixture in goatskin bags near doorways to be knocked by passers-by as a way to keep it thoroughly mixed during fermentation. While you won't find mystical goatskin sacks hanging at the sliding door entrance of your Trader Joe's, you will find Trader Joe's Lowfat Plain Kefir bottled, stocked, and waiting for you! Kefir and yogurt are often unfairly lumped together as the same thing, but at Trader Joe's, we keep plenty of both to suit all shopper's needs! Our Lowfat Plain Kefir is fermented at room temperature with a thinner, more drinkable texture, while most yogurt is fermented under heat and historically has a denser consistency. Additionally, Trader Joe's Lowfat Plain Kefir gives you a larger number of different healthy bacteria, making it the perfect pal for your gastrointestinal health! Top off a tall glass alongside a blend of granola and mixed fruit to start your day! This probiotic-packed party is available daily in a 32-fluid-ounce package for $2.99*.

   "description": "Trader Joe's Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt is made with Grade A Whole Milk. This might conjure images of super fatty milk in your mind, but in truth, whole milk is just 'milk as it comes from the cow'-with none of its original milk fat removed. And that original milk fat isn't as much as one might think. Whole milk doesn't even contain twice as much milk fat as does 2% milk. Still, it's enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a creamier texture-a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases. Beyond the thick, creamy mouth feel, we've also included bits of apricot and mango, with additional fruit juices, to give this Yogurt a tinge of tropical flavor. There are also a host of live and active cultures (added after pasteurization) meant to help bolster the presence of \"good bacteria\" in your gut. Take a tub to work for an easy breakfast. Mix it with some Müesli [sku 56580] for a heartier snack. You can enjoy it anytime since you'll always find Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt in our refrigerators. *Please check QIL to confirm current pricing. Apricot Mango Greek Whole Milk Yogurt",
